The long-term goal of the guideline is to improve the quality of health information. Evidence-based health information represents a prerequisite for informed decision-making. Health information providers lack competences in evidence-based medicine. Therefore, our aim was to develop and pilot-test a blended learning training programme for health information providers to enhance application of the guideline. Methods: 1. Development: We developed the training programme according to the Medical Research Council guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions. The training programme was planned on the basis of problem-based learning. It aims to impart competences in evidence-based medicine. Furthermore, it comprises the application of criteria for evidence-based health information. 2. Pilot testing: We conducted a qualitative pilot study focusing on the acceptability and feasibility of the training programme. Health information providers were recruited and in-house training sessions were offered. Feasibility and acceptability were explored by structured class observations and in semi-structured focus group interviews with the participants after the training sessions. The transcripts and documentations were analysed using qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. The training was revised iteratively according to the results. Results: We conducted two training courses with 17 participants between November 2018 and March 2019. The adequacy of the training for the target group was identified as a major issue. There was significant heterogeneity concerning previous knowledge. Some wished to delve deeper while others seemed to be overwhelmed. In general, the work tasks were understandable. However, the participants asked for a more detailed theoretical introduction in advance. The practical relevance of the evidence-based medicine contents was rated rather low compared to the content about evidence-based health information. Based on these results, we revised the programme. Conclusions: Overall, the training proved to be feasible for implementation. Meeting the needs of all the participants was a challenge, since they were heterogeneous. Not all of them will be able or intend to implement the training contents into their working routine to the full extent. The implementation will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial.

First, to explore ways in which a western-centric in-service teacher education programme has transformed the teaching of 14 teacher participants who hitherto used a more Chinese-centric approach to teaching. Second, to investigate if any changes that have occurred have diffused beyond the teacher participants’ classrooms and if so, to whom and to where. The teacher participants belonged to one of four cohorts of teachers who, between 2014–2019, enrolled onto a UK accredited, level seven, Post Graduate Certificate (International) Education (PGCIE), blended learning programme. All used English as the medium of instruction to teach English, Accounts or Business subjects to Chinese students, aged 18–23. Underpinned by principles of pedagogical gains through reflective practice, the programme’s aim was to develop teacher participants’ practice, with an emphasis on student-led approaches to teaching and learning. Tenets of two theoretical frameworks (transformational learning and diffusion of innovations) furnished a lens to view the data. Data were gathered from interviews with teacher participants and managers. Available and relevant statistical data were also used. The paper presents evidence of how transformational learning leads to improved teacher effectiveness and how changes in practice can become diffused beyond the classroom and to others.

The teaching and learning process is done through technology as an answer to millennial generation struggle. Several higher educations, which A accreditation, have implemented this learning. IAIN Bukittinggi can't have fully actualized blended learning because of that reason. Some educators have done semi-blended learning, like in teaching English economic, the educator uses Kahoot in form of quiz to measure students' achievement of a topic. So this research is aimed at answering research question whether Kahoot App can engage students into English fun learning, how Kahoot is implemented and also to know the benefit and limitation of Kahoot implementation in teaching learning process in IAIN Bukittinggi. This research was held qualitatively. The data were gotten through observation and interview and analyzed descriptively. The findings showed that the English educator had successfully engaged students into English economic fun learning. The students were inspired and motivated to learn English. However, it is expected that institution is going to provide backing media, like LCD and Wi-fi for all classes, in order to support the successful of this gamification program, Kahoot, implementation.

In parallel, a significant effort is invested in training for Digital skills. However, the desired result is not yet achieved since a transformational approach for the primary users of the services, the Public Administration officials, is still missing. A combined approach for the training and the transformation of the services that need to reach certain criteria for interoperability and thus better public cross border cross sector services is presented in this paper. The Greek National Centre of Public Administration and Local Government (EKDDA) identified the need and created a learning model for Public Administration officials. The solution was proposed and implemented to address both issues, with the use of blended learning trainings, open courseware material and tools to assess and evaluate electronic public services via the Interoperability Maturity Assessment Model for a Public Service (IMM-IMAPS). A blended learning model for promoting interoperable government services will not only facilitate digital skills enhancement but will also help create a “digital services interoperability culture”. The level of the evaluation and the assessment of the 98 real case examples of Public services examined during the training sessions, helped organizations identify actions needed to increase the interoperability maturity of their services. An important parameter that was further elaborated is the high percentage of satisfaction of the trainees regarding the presented content and the methods. These methods and practices were also reused by other countries.

The characteristics of its apparatus, which can always be accessed anytime, anywhere, multiuser and offers all its simplicity have made blended learning as a medium of instruction which is very appropriate for the development of education. One of the courses considered essential to utilize the information and communication technology is a research statistics because the process of learning, this course has two fundamental parts which cannot be separated to one another, namely theory and practice. Thus, it needs a plan of learning activities which combine face-to-face learning and online-based learning interaction. The research was required to conduct to develop blended learning on research statistics course for the students of English Education Department of Teacher Training and Education Faculty of Borneo Tarakan University under a Research and Development by using the ADDIE's model. The evaluation which was conducted to find out validity, practicality, and effectiveness of blended learning drew three main conclusions: First, the design and development of learning devices were appropriate to be used as guidelines in implementing the learning process. Second, the process of learning was implemented in accordance with the plans and learning devices as well as a learning setting. Third, the students' learning achievement was classically completed. Thus, the blended learning was found to be valid, practical, and effective for the development of learning.

While in the science of knowledge, learning outcome is measured by effectiveness, efficiency, and attractiveness. Dwiyogo's research [1][2] and 2015 developed a tuition design model that combines face-to-face schooling using offline resources(print, audio, video, computer) and online knowledge training (internet and smart phones) known as Blended Learning-Based Instruction Design Models. Numerous studies have been conducted to test the potency, capability, and fascination of learning. However, the objectives of this study with respect to Dwiyogo's model are:(1) Examining experts on its usage, (2) Applying the model in courses, and (3) Testing the productivity, and capability. This research makes use of the survey and quasi-experimental design methods. The data consists of a total of 3 experts, 113 students, and 6 teachers with result showing that the blended learning model using eight items produced huge output (= 4.750, SD = 0.361). Based on the components of the expert test, it can be concluded that the learning model developed is appropriate and can be implemented. Student opinion with respect to this model showed a high level of agreement (= 3.415, SD = 0.536). This shows that students who applied blended learning based instruction models responded positively to its implementation. Therefore, this technique can enhance knowledge thereby, making the act of efficient, effective, and instruction appeal.

Measuring the outcomes of education and the progress of learning has an essential role in generating personalised feedbacks and recommendations in personalised learning. The data obtained by traditional assessment tools like written and oral examinations, mass assignments do not reflect the real state of the student's knowledge and progress of learning. Learning activities outside the classroom are not observable adding to the imprecision of recommendations. This paper share one of our assessment practice called 'open assessment method' developed and practiced during 2012-2015 along with the design of a decision support system. It is built around a 'class activity sheet' with Google technologies, enhances the observability of the learning environment. This technological adaption leads to improvement in student's participation, generating data useful for composing recommendations on a personal basis with teacher's interventions.

Research and development towards such innovative learning systems has therefore evolved into an expanding field. Two of the key challenges are (1) to automate the extraction of expert knowledge and (2) the development of an advanced domain model, on which the system can draw. To tackle these challenges, our interdisciplinary contribution is to suggest adopting a novel approach to creating educational knowledge graphs of texts (1), which can then be further annotated and supplemented by instructors and students (2). In particular, we will outline practical use cases for blended learning scenarios in Higher Education.

The methods used for assessment are of prime pedagogical importance as they have a direct bearing on both teaching and learning provision and the learning experience. Assessment methods must be planned so that they align well with intended learning outcomes in e-assessment procedures in particular, in order to ensure reliable and secure learner authentication and authorship in online and blended learning environments. A framework for quality assurance in trust-based e-assessment processes was developed in accordance with these objectives. The framework has been designed in line with the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG) to assure the applicability of the e-assessment system to all online and blended learning environments while respecting the shared European framework for quality assurance (QA). This chapter provides contextual information on the quality assurance of higher education in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and presents in more detail the rationale behind the development of the framework, together with aspects that need to be taken into consideration when designing and implementing the quality assurance of e-assessment.

However, the time for classroom lessons is limited, so we had to think about a didactical concept which provides both: on the one hand an efficient and for the students attractive way to transfer the theory and on the other hand more time in the classroom lectures in order to practice skills and improve interactivity and collaboration among students and teachers. Having in mind that we had to provide more room for practical lessons in small groups and to transfer theoretical knowledge and refresher content in a most efficient way, the concept of flipped classroom in combination with blended learning were the most obvious choices. In order to apply the concept of a flipped classroom we performed a series of workshops with the involved teachers and developed with them four different virtual formats in order to make the delivery of the theoretical and refresher content as attractive, effective and interesting as possible. Technically we utilized our lecture recording system in combination with editing and a professional play out for the students. We also performed an accompanying student evaluation in order to get some feedback on the effectiveness of our approach. Last but not least we will share all our experiences gained in this project, which can easily be applied also to other subjects of teaching.

Part-time students (all already working) start with heterogeneous knowledge, various practical experiences and different ages which leads to diverse learning types. Additionally, the number of students in our bachelor program has been doubled over the past five years. In this paper we present a step-by-step transformation process toward a flipped classroom model based on several digitalization techniques which are also used in industrial practice and open source communities. We recommend such a gradual transformation which is based on evaluation and feedback to reduce risks. Also, efforts needed for this transformation can be distributed throughout many years.

Background: There is a need for longitudinal studies of the flipped classroom approach in general. Although a few cross-sectional studies show that a flipped classroom approach can increase student learning by providing more time for other in-class activities, such as active learning, such studies are also rare in the context of teaching software engineering. Intended Outcomes: To assess the usefulness of a flipped classroom approach in teaching software engineering. Application Design: The study was conducted at an international master's program in Sweden, given in English, and partially replicated at a university in Africa. Findings: The results suggest that students' academic success, as measured by their exam grades, can be improved by introducing a flipped classroom to teach software engineering topics, but this may not extend to their subjective liking of the material, as measured by student evaluations. Furthermore, the effect of the change in the teaching methodology was not replicated when changing the teaching team.

Ferguson et al. (2016) outlined the challenges, opportunities and proposed evaluation of the NES Specialist Supervision Training in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (NESSST-CBT). The aims of the training were to provide an evidence-based, flexible and learner-focused training in CBT specific supervision competencies. This paper will provide an update on the evaluation of the training using Kirkpatrick's Impact Evaluation Model (1967, 1987). Results indicate that: (1) delegates rated the training experience positively in various ways; (2) delegates described increases in their confidence and competence in using structured measures of CBT and supervision; (3) a majority of delegates completing a 3-month follow-up questionnaire described continued use of a structured CBT measure in supervision and for self-reflection; and (4) 392 psychological therapists in Scotland have now been formally trained in CBT specific supervision skills. NESSST-CBT continues to adapt and improve as a resource for staff as NES moves forward in its Digital Strategy for Scotland's NHS and partnership staff. Further implications of this are discussed, as well as limitations of the study.Key learning aims(1)Readers will be able to further understand the multi-faceted role of NHS Education for Scotland in implementing CBT supervision training in Scotland.(2)Readers will be able to list three key outcomes from the feedback data on 4 years of a specialist supervision blended-learning training for CBT supervision.(3)Readers will be able to identify three key limitations of the study and recommendations for future research.

The data in the study have been collected from 25 instructors who have been actively teaching in UNITEN. The results show that the instructors are generally motivated and ready for BL. The most motivating factor is providing flexible learning environment using ICT. The other factors surveyed include interest of student in using technology for learning, willingness of instructor for online discussion, effectiveness of online learning, enrichment of student’s experience via BL and improvement in student participation through online collaboration. This study is concluded with recommendations on the categories of instructor who may need more attention to further improve their readiness.

While many studies examine the effects of TPD strategies, fewer studies target the specific important components of these strategies. This study addresses that gap by conducting a systematic review of qualitative data consisting of 15 articles on TPD that targets OBL. Using a meta-aggregative approach, six different synthesised findings were identified and integrated into a visual framework of the key components of TPD for OBL. These synthesised findings are the base for the action recommendations which present specific and contextualised suggestions. Taken together, the findings can inform in-service teachers and trainers, together with further research and development efforts that are concerned with TPD for OBL.

While in the science of knowledge, learning outcome is measured by effectiveness, efficiency, and attractiveness. Dwiyogo's research (2013, 2014, and 2015) developed a tuition design model that combines face-to-face schooling using offline resources (print, audio, video, computer) and online knowledge training (internet and smart phones) known as Blended Learning-Based Instruction Design Models. Numerous studies have been conducted to test the potency, capability, and fascination of learning. However, the objectives of this study with respect to Dwiyogo’s model are: (1) examining experts on it usage, (2) applying the model in courses, and (3) testing the productivity, and capability. This research makes use of the survey and quasi-experimental design methods. The data consists of a total of 3 experts, 113 students, and 6 teachers with result showing that the blended learning model using eight items produced huge output (= 4.750, SD = 0.361). Based on the components of the expert test, it can be concluded that the learning model developed is appropriate and can be implemented. Student opinion with respect to this model showed a high level of agreement (= 3.415, SD = 0.536). This shows that students who applied blended learning based instruction models responded positively to its implementation. Therefore, this technique can enhance knowledge thereby, making the act of efficient, effective, and instruction appeal.

In the 2019, action research was conducted in Airline Business classes of International College, Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University, Thailand. In the blended learning, the researcher created online lessons of his lectures and the students viewed them prior to attending class. The International Air Transport Association is a trade association of the world's airlines. That is consisting of 290 airlines, primarily major carriers, representing 117 countries, the IATA's member airlines account for carrying approximately 82% of total of air traffic in the world. Thailand is now on the path of industrialization, the need of new innovation and technology product is a must the reach this goal. A new method of learning that is called blended learning has been introduces for this IATA class to enable student benefit from learning. In the blended learning, the researcher created online lessons of his lectures and the students viewed them prior to attending class. Students worked on problem-solving activities in their classrooms. The students used smart phones, tablets & computer. The research findings indicated that the blended learning of instruction was new teaching strategy that moved the lecture on outside classroom via technology and brought assignments/exercises of IATA contents and concepts inside the classroom via learning activities. The research findings shown the students engagement in the blended learning were higher than the using traditional classroom. Based on the students' interviews they revealed that using blended learning incorporated with smartphone and students group activities they were able to make learning fun and challenging.

Thinking is the ability to challenge and eventually develop acquired knowledge to a higher attainment level.The proposed framework models here are intended for developing, stimulating, and engaging students' complex thinking process skills. This is a higher-order thinking level and consists of four subthinking skills, i.e., problem-solving, critical thinking, creative thinking, and decision-making. Common and supporting thinking skills of these four levels are identified and derived from the literature, and additional sublearning skills are defined as general capacities to perform a set of tasks and further development of students' higher-order thinking abilities. Furthermore, questions for focusing thinking or learning activities are developed to transform learned knowledge and skills into practical activities. Hence, course assignments (e.g., homework and quizzes) and learning tools (e.g., mind map, flowchart) were developed to engage students in developing their skills in these four thinking levels. Learning assignments and tasks, as related to complex thinking and related subthinking skills, can be mapped to students' learning outcomes, assessed, and eventually allow evaluating learning skills. Proposed teaching activities' initial assessments show high improvement in student learning and were applied successfully in higher education and partially tested first-grade students. Furthermore, it is implemented using a blended learning approach through providing skills-based assignments (e.g., homework, quizzes), interactive lectures, and using learning tools such as mind maps. Initial assessment of students' outcomes showed an improvement by 20% as compared with course sections with typical course delivery mode.

Methods: Interviews were conducted with 13 graduates of a hybrid (e.g. blended-learning) fellowship program. All participants were at least 1 year post completion of fellowship to limit recall bias and allow for post-training personal and professional development. Qualitative analysis was performed on interview transcriptions using directed content analysis with two coders other than the interviewers, followed by discussion until agreement was reached if there were disputes related to coding analysis. If needed, arbitration was provided from one of two interviewers. Results: Analysis revealed three primary constructs of post-fellowship impact: practical, social, and personal. Practical subthemes were centric to care delivery. Social subthemes extended to intra, inter, and non-professional connections. Personal subthemes noted professional and cognitive evolution. Discussion: Participants clearly described impact extending well beyond day-to-day practice suggesting that fellowship impacted the whole person versus sole practitioner.

This makes it difficult for teachers to adapt existing systems or to attempt in creating a similar version. Recently, we have leveraged the IBM Watson Assistant chatbot engine to develop some chatbots. These chatbots have been adopted in a common core (general education) course for inquiry-based learning, with a promising outcome. In this workshop, we would like to share our experience gained from developing a set of chatbots for an online blended learning environment. Through the workshop, attendees will identify what and how chatbots can be designed for their own blended or fully online courses. They will also develop a simple chatbot system that can responses to some assessment inquiries.

A graduate of a higher educational institution of any qualification is required to possess not only theoretical knowledge, but also practical skills in solving problems in the professional sphere. The use of traditional learning (lectures, workshops, seminars) often leads to the passivity of students and does not cause much interest in the manifestation of their capabilities. Therefore, one of the tasks of modern education is to increase the interest on the part of students to acquire knowledge, on the other hand, to activate their activity in acquiring this knowledge independently. One of the important factors for improving the system of training professional personnel in higher education is the active use of more effective teaching methods and technologies in the educational process, in particular, e-learning, distance learning technologies.

Firstly, lecture-style teaching was conducted with presentation slides in order to explain the contents of a textbook. Secondly, students were required to do exercises and quizzes. By using the last eight weeks, they were asked to create presentation slides outside a class to introduce the up-to-date topics on artificial intelligence. These slides were mutually evaluated among them so that they developed their own slides based on the feedback before the tenth week of the course for the second round of mutual evaluations. Questionnaires concerning students’ understanding technical terms of the field and consciousness-raising towards competence were also conducted before and after the programs. The learning effects of a module in ‘AI Technology’ are compared with my previous research outcome of the module, ‘Artificial Intelligence’. The reasons of difference between both modules are discussed. This paper reports their results.

We examine several types of neural networks, including a novel technique that blends the Fourier scattering transform with a convolutional neural network. This method is naturally suited for the representation of hyperspectral data because it decomposes signals into multi-frequency bands, removing small perturbations such as noise, while also having the capability of neural networks to learn a hierarchical representation. We test our proposed method on the standard Pavia University hyperspectral dataset and demonstrate a new training set sampling strategy that reveals the inherent spatial bias present in some purely neural network methods. The results indicate that our form of blended learning is more effective at representing spectral data and less prone to overfitting the artificial spatial bias in hyperspectral data.

The content was created and adapted by students, teachers and a voting mechanism of the system. Information of microscopic images could be accessed by students. This blended learning gave students the opportunity to select the learning methods that best suited their own preferences, traditional method, a new method or both. Furthermore, we analyzed the students’ satisfaction and opinions of the tool. The results showed the students were satisfied with the content development and thought the tool was useful for microscopic learning.

In small group exercises and self-examination exercises, students can use, practice, and deepen what they have learned. In order to assist the students in this learning process, teachers try to provide a reasonable number of exercises. Against the background of the digitalization of teaching and blended learning concepts such as electronic exams, serious gamification and individual learning paths it is necessary to provide the ability to generate exercises automatically. Tough, the main challenge is to generate genuinely random tasks. In this contribution Tool2Task, a tool for the automated generation of mechanism theory tasks, is presented. A first step towards individual random tasks was done by developing appropriate algorithms and basic functions for a web based application. This application is able to generate random tasks based on lists of equations, application-related task topics and algorithms for solving the desired types of exercises.

For prospective mining engineers, a comprehensive understanding of complex 3D processes is crucial but is difficult to convey in traditional ways. The benefits of VR are the possible direct 3D immersion into locations that are remote, too costly to visit and/or unsafe. To improve future graduate education, an informative and interactive underground VR environment is being developed by RWTH Aachen University and TalTech University, called the VR-Mine. It is based on the concepts of blended learning, gamification and flipped classroom, and focusses on the topics health and safety, and principles of underground mining. Furthermore, it could help increasing the industry’s health and safety standards with specialised training in safe environments. The vision of the project is to create a comprehensive VR mining environment where all process-related aspects of a mine’s life can be explored.

With the aim of identifying groups of students who would benefit from the same intervention, in this paper, we study a set of 104 weekly behaviors observed for 26 students in a blended learning environment with AC-ware Tutor, an ontology-based intelligent tutoring system. Online learning behavior in AC-ware Tutor is described using 8 tracking variables: (i) the total number of content pages seen in the learning process; (ii) the total number of concepts seen in the learning process; (iii) the total content proficiency score gained online; (iv) the total time spent online; (v) the total number of student logins to AC-ware Tutor; (vi) the stereotype value after the initial test in AC-ware Tutor, (vii) the final stereotype value in the learning process, and (viii) the mean stereotype variability in the learning process. The previous measures are used in a four-step analysis process that includes the following elements: Data preprocessing (Z-score normalization), dimensionality reduction (Principal component analysis), the clustering (K-means), and the analysis of a posttest performance on a content proficiency exam. By using the Euclidean distance in K-means clustering, we identified 4 distinct online learning behavior clusters, which we designate by the following names: Engaged Pre-knowers, Pre-knowers Non-finishers, Hard-workers, and Non-engagers. The posttest proficiency exam scores were compared among the aforementioned clusters using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Educators on the front lines who face the day-to-day challenges of promoting engagement in BL settings have remained particularly sceptical. Considerable scholarship has focussed on faculty reticence in adopting effective BL practices, yet offering few solutions. Results of our earlier 3-year longitudinal study at a private-for-profit university in Chile, shed light on complex circumstances that explain why many faculty have not embraced BL and the often-disappointing results of those who do. The findings provided insight into multi-level identity issues within our institution that influence teaching and learning in BL classrooms. In this paper, we report on a 6-month follow-up AR (AR) study we conducted to address those issues. Our aim was to provide collaborative and sustained expert e-learning pedagogical and IT support for a group of thirteen faculty, including a set of strategies to counteract the barriers preventing these educators and their 320 students from adopting effective BL practices. Framed by theories of identity and transformational change, in the study we co-constructed alternative ways of viewing and doing BL teaching and learning with this group of educators. Qualitative data collection tools involved: interviews, recorded field notes from online participant meetings and class blogs and an end-of-semester student Likert scale questionnaire. Findings indicate that when faculty are provided long-term institutionally-supported opportunities and collaborative guidance in how to assume agency and control in their BL teaching settings and are simultaneously encouraged to empower their students to do the same in their learning, the resulting identities they themselves mediate and in turn foster in their students have positive implications for learning outcomes-increased self-directedness, online engagement, community building and higher order thinking. We believe these results provide renewed and grounded hope for the future of BL.

The studies in Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) have been a part of the degree program in Health Promotion since 2016, including Bachelor in Health Sciences and Master in Health Sciences. The duration of the qualification is five years (180A +A 120 ECTS). The objective of the degree program is to educate specialists in Ergonomics, who can design work and work environments based on scientific knowledge. The content of the education corresponds to the qualification of the European Ergonomists set by Centre for Registration of European Ergonomist (CREE). The students are mainly adult learners living in different areas of Finland. Integrating their thesis into the ongoing development projects in working life provides a meaningful way of learning. In addition, our degree programme utilizes web based learning varying from tutored courses and blended learning to self-study and case-based courses on central topics in HFE. Web-based learning is particularly suitable in Finland due to long distances. The graduates in Ergonomics have commonly been employed in many occupations where they can utilize the knowledge from their studies. The field of Ergonomics in working life is broad, and it is impossible for one educational organization to offer comprehensive education, but in collaboration with different stakeholders we believe we have a good chance to develop the discipline in Finland.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide a platform for building skills at scale in the region. Scholars of evaluation have long pointed to a gap between supply and demand that frustrates both evaluation practitioners and commissioners. This article explores the possibilities and limitations of MOOCs to bridge this gap. Objectives: This article seeks to explore the role open online training can play in evaluation capacity development. It considers the implications of one course's experience of evaluation-sector-blended learning and instructional design in Africa for strengthening regional communities of practice, and for evaluation capacity development. Method: This article draws on current theories on online learning, specific course data from the Theory of Change course as well as experiential learning from two processes of revision and delivery of the MOOC to explore open online learning as an approach to evaluation capacity development. Results: This study has found that MOOCs can play important roles in evaluation capacity development. They can raise awareness of methods and tools that are not part of traditional monitoring and evaluation curriculum, their reach for evaluation practitioners is wide and they build much needed networks in the sector. However, their role in skills development has limits, particularly if they are delivered in isolation of other accessible contact learning options. Conclusion: Massive Open Online Courses should be one part of an evaluation capacity development strategy. They support blended learning, expand access to certain core practical skills and link evaluation practitioners to other real outlets of learning and exchange.

Hybrid learning environments refer to specific networks of classroom learning and online-based learning that have previously been understood as blended learning. However, the emergence of new, intelligent assisted learning systems makes it necessary to redefine hybrid-learning environments. The article therefore deals with the specific features and functions of intelligent tutoring in foreign language teaching and deals with the learning technology requirements that these systems must meet in order to be able to find a new qualitative place in hybrid learning environments. The learning environment LSI.online is used as an example to illustrate the central function of intelligent assistance.

The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is a measure of teachers pedagogical, content and technical knowledge and their skill to embed technology in practice. Using the TPACK framework, this study explores the relationship between technical skills, learning design and how these relate to pedagogy. The study also investigates how TPACK varies by subject area, teaching qualification, and employment. A survey of 112 lecturers from a multi-campus university was conducted. We found that lecturers who have high TPACK tend to use more varied and interactive learning activities. TPACK did not significantly vary by subject area. It did not also vary between those who received a few trainings over the past year in comparison to those who didn’t. However, significant differences in TPACK were found in terms of nature of employment and teaching qualification in higher education. These findings suggest that there is a need to provide a varied approach to develop staff competencies.

The core of the study was to design and implement a model of fitness tracker-supported running classes. A two-year survey among university students (n = 133) was carried out to analyse and evaluate the usability and possible benefits of the applied blended learning methods. The number of students who passed the assignment criteria of fitness running increased and the percentage of drop-outs decreased in the experimental group. The results indicated enhanced motivation of students to enroll and participate in fitness running. The highest rated formal benefit of the designed model of fitness tracker-supported running was found in individual choice of time and place.

Engineering higher education is in need of modernization in order to link student skills to labour market needs. Skills necessary for supporting economic growth include both a sound theoretical background as well as transversal competencies such as problem-solving capacity, creativity, and analytical thinking. This work presents a problem-based learning framework that aims to more effectively develop students for transitioning into the world of work. This is pursued through active educational approaches supported by digital learning services that promote collaboration, innovative mindsets, autonomous, and self-relying work. The proposed platform facilitates learning experiences that integrate simulations and serious games linked to real world challenges in the context of wider, blended learning practices. The framework is being developed by a network of European and South Asian universities with the objective of integrating needs from diverse cultural, economic, and educational environments resulting into an educational platform with international relevance.

A first-year mathematics for engineering unit offered at a large, metropolitan Australian university provides the context for this research. As part of the project, the unit was redesigned using a framework that employed flexible, modular, connected e-learning and teaching experiences. The researchers, interested in an ecological perspective on educational processes, grounded the redesign principles in probabilistic learning design (Kirschner et al., 2004). The effectiveness of the redesigned environment was assessed through the lens of the notion of affordance (Gibson, 1977,1979, Greeno, 1994, Good, 2007). A qualitative analysis of the questionnaire distributed to students at the end of the teaching period provided insight into factors impacting on the successful creation of an environment that encourages complex, multidimensional and multilayered interactions conducive to learning.

In this article, we use the constructs of place, space, and power to explore the decentering of feedback on students’ writing from the face-to-face, physical location of the Centre to the formative assessment space in a module. We reflect on the Centre’s engagement with a formative online feedback intervention conducted by a lecturer within a Bachelor of Education Honours course. Writing centre tutors participated in providing formative feedback on nested, scaffolded tasks leading to a long essay, using the feedback function of the Turnitin platform. The space of engagement with students moved from the face-to-face, physical writing centre location to the online space. We found that the development of the academic writing and feedback literacies of writing tutors, students, and the lecturer were developed through sustained and responsive online and face-to-face communities of praxis. In this process, there was a partial decentering and recentering of the role of the Centre, enabled by technology and the integration of the development of academic literacies within the course curriculum. The sustained engagement between the lecturer, tutors, and writing centre coordinator played an essential role in the effectiveness of the intervention. However, in order to further develop the feedback literacies of students, the online feedback needs to be complemented with additional face-to-face interaction. We argue for both a decentering and recentering of the role of writing centres towards supporting departments in the integration of academic literacies development into curricula. One of the ways of doing this is by using technology to expand capacity in order to give students feedback on their writing within a blended learning environment that focuses on formative assessment.

The use of MOOCs in brick and mortar courses presents several design challenges. One of them is to find the most suitable online course regarding the alignment with the face-to-face course structure, timeline and syllabus. Despite there are different lesson planning and design tools which support educators in the design of their courses, there is a lack of solutions allowing to incorporate the use of MOOC or MOOC resources in the planning process of blended courses. In this paper, we present a MOOC design module for being used in design authoring tools which aim to support the planning of blended courses that incorporate MOOCs (or MOOCs resources). We discuss two different solutions for gathering information regarding existing MOOCs in the market: The creation of our own MOOC database versus the parsing of MOOC information from existing search engines on demand. Our exploration leads us to discard the first solution as maintaining the database is highly demanding. Thus, the final system uses existing MOOC search engines to extract the online courses design information to later be used in the overall hybrid-course planning. As it is a work-in-progress article, we present and discuss our future steps for supporting educators in the of design hybrid MOOCs scenarios.

This professional environment has deeply changed after digital media were added to traditional media. Multimedia have imposed a different approach to PR and generated new jobs on the labor market. Today, a PR graduate should be familiar with the online environment, should be skilled at managing social media accounts, at web design, since multimedia production has become a hiring condition in this field. A PR specialist should develop linguistic, discursive and digital skills. Besides these, a professional must also acquire specific knowledge from the field so as to be able to produce effective messages. However, the training of PR specialists is usually centered around the development of discursive skills. In the present article, nonetheless, we advocate for the importance of developing digital competencies in PR and we argue that this training segment can be made more efficient by using e-learning methods. Yet, the article draws attention to the fact that there are PR training segments that cannot be carried out through e-learning. PR specialists must be able to offer a memorable user experience to their target audience. In order to fulfill this purpose, it is necessary to develop multiple skills needed to create both the content and the form of the conveyed messages. Accessibility, content strategy, design thinking, information architecture, interaction design, multidevice design should be major concerns in the training of competitive PR specialists. Online platforms devoted to PR training are part of blended learning strategies and offer users the possibility to interact with current information through nonlinear learning methods, and enhance the development of creativity through interactive applications.

This CAD course aims at lifting as many students as possible to a preferably high and well-defined level of competence. At the same time, the teacher's workload can be kept within limits that allow him or her to spend the majority of his or her capacity on supporting the individual student. In order to reach this aim in spite of common unfavourable teaching conditions a complex pedagogical concept of individual learning in large groups has been developed. The six key elements of this concept are the following: - Tutorials: Imparting content and methods by way of video-tutorials, including adoption of the new material by becoming actively involved. - Training: Practicing the new material by repeating and training CAD strategies and software commands up to firm mastering. - Transfer: Transfer of the newly acquired competences to more sophisticated problems based on successful completion of the component’s tutorial and training. - Team-Tutoring: Support in case of problems is given promptly by networking in learning groups of four. - Tutor-Attestation: Permanent and immediate feedback on the participant´s own learning progress is provided by the tutor. - Trust: The experience of successfully traversing through the different stages provides trust in the lecturer and in the concepts taught, thus accelerating the learning process. This course has already been carried out several times with great success at three universities and has been further optimised.

Not all of these strategies have been successful in identification of student motivation or showing student learning because the courses are predicative, and static. The courses become less desirable for both adults and young adults as they can learn topics in micro-learning platform, bite sized content from YouTube or other open learning platforms. Universities that utilize online learning as their primary mode of delivery need to explore opportunities for flexibly of content and student engagement. In 2018, a Walden University Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program began a program update to address the issue of student flexibility and ways of improving assessment of learning. Taking a self-directed learning approach to complex topics within the program content courses allows the students to explore the content in a personal meaningful way, allows students to take control of their learning and find ways to improve their intrinsic learning capacity. By allowing flexibility in student learning, this can cause difficulties in assessing the student learning outcomes for the course and program. Students using a self-directed learning approach should be assessed utilizing controlled variables that are embedded with the curriculum, implementation of feedback received, and reflection of the student learning process. This paper and poster will outline a case study that provides context to why andragogy is critical at graduate level learning and inspiring student creativity and building skills that serve students as their work environments demand independence and critical thinking capacity. This work unique, innovative, and has the potential to support student development at all levels of learning. Given the generational differences and the desire for micro-learning, this case study encourages self-directed learning, intrinsic motivation, and new methods of assessment.

It is recommended to use alternative teaching methods in order to increase the accessibility of CPR training. The study was carried out to assess the effectiveness of the blended approach to resuscitation training, where classroom training hours are partially substituted with remote learning. MATERIAL AND METhODS This prospective randomized study was conducted in November-December 2018. Nursing students and nonmedical university students underwent classroom training (1 hour of lecture, 3 hours of hands-on training) or blended training (1 hour of on-line course, 3 hours of hands-on training) in basic CPR with automated external defibrillation (AED). CPR knowledge and willingness to attempt resuscitation were evaluated before and after the training, and resuscitation skills were assessed as well after training in a simulation scenario. CPR quality measures were registered using the skills checklist when analyzing video recordings, and automatically by means of the Resusci Anne QCPR manikin. RESuLTS The training and the study assessments were completed by 94 participants: 55 - classroom training, 39 - blended training. The mean age was 19 years and 17 years, respectively, 24% and 31% were male. Whereas there were more participants with previous training in CPR in the classroom training group (36% vs. 13%; p<0.05), the baseline levels of knowledge and readiness to perform resuscitation on a stranger were generally comparable between the groups. After the training, there was an increase in willingness to perform resuscitation (from 3.6 to 4.4 points in both groups) and improvement in self-perceived CPR knowledge (from 2.4 to 4.0 points in the classroom training group and from 2.6 to 4.3 in the blended training group). The assessment of the CPR quality in the simulation scenario revealed no significant differences between groups, excepting higher rate of chest compressions in the blended training group (116.0 vs. 109.4, р<0.01). CONCLuSION The suggested method of blended training in basic CPR with AED is no less efficient than traditional classroom training, and it can be recommended for increasing access to high-quality training in first aid.

These examples have become increasingly prevalent in online and blended learning environments. Yet, specific guidelines for designing video modeling examples to optimize learning are scarce. One design aspect in which much variation is evident is whether the instructor is visible in the video. The instructor will attract learners’ attention, at the expense of attention to what s/he is explaining and/or demonstrating. The question is whether that would affect learning. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of the mere presence of an instructor in a video example on attention allocation and learning. Participants’ (N = 54) eye movements were recorded while they observed a video example on probability calculation that did or did not show the instructor. Subsequently, participants had to solve probability calculation problems like those presented in the video example. Results showed that learners in the ‘instructor visible’ condition looked at the instructor's face about 30% of the time while studying the video example, and there was no decline in attention to the instructor over time. However, there were no significant differences in learning outcomes among conditions.

Methods: A between-subjects experimental design was used: participants - a whole cohort of second-year medical students (N=232) - were randomly assigned to either a formative assessment that covered the topic of a subsequent practical course (treatment condition) or a formative assessment that did not cover the topic of the subsequent course (control condition). Course-script-knowledge, as well as additional in-depth-knowledge, was assessed. Results: Students in the treatment condition had better course-script knowledge, both at the beginning, t(212) = 4.96, p < .01, d = 0.72., and in the end of the practical course , t(208) = 4.80, p < .01, d = 0.68. Analyses of covariance show that this effect is stronger for those students who understood the feedback that was presented within the formative assessment, F(1, 213)=10.17, p<.01. Additionally, the gain of in-depth-knowledge was significantly higher for students in the treatment condition compared to students in the control condition, t(208) = 3.68., p < .05, d = 0.72 (0.51). Conclusions: Students benefit from a formative assessment that is related to and takes place before a subsequent practical course. They have a better understanding of the topic and gain more in-depth-knowledge that goes beyond the content of the script.

According to the current assumption that blended learning equates to the mixture of on-line conferencing and traditional face-to-face learning and contacting. This approach is useful as well as for teaching at institutions as well as for the mobility of students and teachers. Technological possibilities are especially important, while they enable the mobility of students and teachers, in the cases like economic reasons, time constraints, family needs or any other reasons. Without technological supported mobility, those participants would not be able to experience exchange. By mixing technologies and different learning approaches, much has changed in education. Among the new additional challenges of today's education are cross cultural challenges and preparation. Considering this awareness, project experiences and practices in various projects related to blended learning and cultural issues, we will present our suggestions and lessons learned in cross cultural preparation.

With Backstage, these challenges were tackled by introducing a backchannel coupled with an audience response system into large-class lectures. A backchannel enables students to post questions and answer to questions without the fear of speaking out; an audience response system supports quizzes that help keeping the students' attention. The first version of Backstage focussed exclusively on lectures; an updated version supports a variety of learning and teaching formats that can be conceived by composing core components. Backstage provides a set of generic components that can be combined in order to create different formats ranging from completely asynchronous, to blended learning, to completely synchronous. Additionally, Backstage provides gamification features that go beyond run-of-the-mill solutions as points, badges, and leaderboards and learning analytics. In the demonstration, the main components of Backstage, the collaborative annotation tool, the vertical stream, the audience response system, the gamification, and the learning analytics are introduced and their use demonstrated by means of a variety of learning and teaching formats implemented using the components.

It has been observed that the data is growing at a fast pace, therefore there must be certain techniques which will help to improve the conventional teaching methods in order to tackle with the young minds curiosities. To address the issue, a new educational model called 4-Step-Model is proposed. It can be used in parallel that support both the online and traditional face-to-face learning. Model includes-Planning, Modeling, Implementation and Testing phase. It implements big data analytics and blended learning methods to access the technology usage. Utilizes advanced analytics method combining learning analytics and blended learning techniques aiming to enhance the quality of education. The potential outcome of this model will be improved results in the learning behavior of a student such as better performance, enhanced learning effect, and advanced growth rates. This underlines the need and significance of 4SM as an educational model with the talent already in the hands of an educator and learner that can be used to incorporate technology in the educational bodies.

This study may be of interest to those who wish to offer flexible learning environments to adults who require to pursue advanced training in institutions where they believe in technology-based socio-constructivism and where not necessarily there is a single educational and operational model to offer learning opportunities. Keeping the essence of the seminar methodology that guides the MPTIC and the multi-dimensionality that assumes the hybrid learning modality in this master's degree program, it was conducted the redesign and testing of the second level of a seminar offered to one of the cohorts of the MPTIC. In this process the actors were the same as in the first level-the same students participated, were guided by the same faculty members, and were accompanied by the same managers, but the operational model of the second level of the course of interest was adjusted to overcome some of the limitations found out in the implementation of the first level course. This had the intention of seeking more active participation at individual and group level, as well as to achieve better qualitative results in the application of what has been learned to the teaching environments in which the participants of the MPTIC do their deepening projects. This study sought to determine what lessons this pedagogical transformation leaves, in the face of its possible replication in other courses of the MPTIC and / or in contexts and by other actors of advanced training programs at the service of people who work and study, and who require making use of flexible learning environments. The work leaves to consideration lessons learned and recommendations.

An adherence simulation exercise was included in a course on paediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) to stimulate health care providers' awareness and generate empathy of complex paediatric adherence practices. AIM:  The aim of this study was to describe the experience of clinicians completing the simulation exercise and to assess whether enhancing their empathy with patients and treatment supporters would improve their perceived clinical and counselling skills. SETTING:  The study was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, and a guesthouse in Cape Town. METHODS:  The adherence module used blended learning methodology consisting of face-to-face contact sessions and distance learning. A qualitative thematic approach was used to understand the participant experiences through focus-group discussions and semi-structured interviews. RESULTS:  Three thematic clusters emerged, namely, experiences of the simulated exercise, patient-provider relationships and adherence strategies. Their experiences were both positive and challenging, especially when a 'caregiver and/or treatment supporter' scenario encouraged participants to reflect on their own relationships with their patients. Clinicians had also considered how empathy fits into their scope of responsibilities. Text messaging and adherence counselling strategies were identified. CONCLUSION:  Simulated learning activities have the potential to create awareness of relationships between clinicians and their patients and generate ideas and discussion that could lead to improvements in clinical practice, and adherence promotion strategies",antiretroviral therapy;caregiver;counselling;simulation;treatment supporter,"anti human immunodeficiency virus agent;adult;child;clinical competence;doctor patient relationship;empathy;female;health personnel attitude;human;human immunodeficiency virus infection;information processing;interview;male;medical education;medication compliance;middle aged;patient simulation;primary health care;procedures;south africa;young adult;adult;anti-hiv agents;attitude of health personnel;child;clinical competence;education, medical, continuing;empathy;female;focus groups;hiv infections;humans;interviews as topic;male;medication adherence;middle aged;patient simulation;physician-patient relations;primary health care;south africa;young adult",,Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056720312,4,0.25,United States,United States,stellenbosch university,stellenbosch university,activities;adherence;adherence counselling;adherence module;adherence practice;adherence promotion;adherence simulation;adherence strategy;aim;andor;andor treatment;antiretroviral therapy;approach;art;assess;awareness;background;cape;cape town;care;care facility;care provider;caregiver;caregiver andor;clinical practice;clinician completing;clinicians;clusters;complex paediatric;conclusion;contact;contact session;course;create;create awareness;describe;discussion;discussions;distance;distance learning;empathy;empathy fit;exercise;experience;experiences;facetoface;facetoface contact;facilities;faculty;fits;focusgroup;focusgroup discussion;generate;generate empathy;generate idea;guesthouse;health;health care;health science;hiv;human;human immunodeficiency;ideas;immunodeficiency;immunodeficiency virus;improvements;interviews;lead;learning activity;medicine;methodology;methods;module;need;paediatric;paediatric adherence;paediatric antiretroviral;paediatric human;participant;participant experience;participants;patientprovider;patientprovider relationship;patients;practice;practices;primary;primary health;promotion;promotion strategy;provider awareness;providers;qualitative;qualitative thematic;reflect;relationships;responsibilities;results;scenario;sciences;scope;sessions;shift;simulated exercise;simulated learning;simulation;simulation exercise;skills;stellenbosch;stellenbosch university;stimulate;stimulate health;strategies;study;support;support adherence;supporter;supporter scenario;supporters;tb;text;text messaging;thematic approach;thematic cluster;therapy;therapy art;town;train;train clinician;treatment;treatment supporter;tuberculosis;tuberculosis tb;understand;university;virus;virus hiv,adherence;adherence exercise;antiretroviral therapy;clinician experience;clinicians;exercise;experience;qualitative;qualitative study;simulated antiretroviral;study;therapy;therapy adherence,83

Six focus group interviews examined factors that participants considered enabled them to develop programme competencies as well as those that acted as barriers to competency development. Results indicated that a range of factors had acted as barriers to or enablers of competency development. These focused on five overarching themes related to: course content, relevance, clarity and structure; support networks; managing time and stress; pre-requisite knowledge, skills, and experience; access to technology. The implications of these factors for the further development of blended learning programmes are identified.

Then, this teaching model will be practiced in English writing class for 16 weeks. According to writing exam, 64 students are selected to be our participants in the research. 32 students are classified in the control group in which traditional teaching mode is employed in writing class. Other 32 students are defined as experiment group in which students are taught in the teaching model within the blended learning mode. The data from pre-test and post-test have been made in paired sample T tests. The results from online course platform and pre-test and post-test suggest that the teaching model within blended learning mode can significantly improve students’ English writing ability in terms of four aspects: content relevance, content sufficiency, organization structure and language expression.

In the field of Renewable Energy education, the blended-learning master's degree program Renewable Energy Online has been developed at the University of Oldenburg, Germany. This article aims at presenting the concept of this program. Thereby, it focuses on learning-teaching concepts, which address the motivation of students and the needs and resources of diverse groups of students.

To fulfil the objective of supervision, some conditions are needy: first of all, a confidential relationship between supervisor and supervisee and, second, a safe and supportive environment. It is a question whether it is possible to cover such demanding conditions when teaching supervision to part-time students of distance studies. The aim of this article is thus to discuss the challenges and opportunities of teaching social work supervision in the form of blended learning where diverse elements of distance learning are used (e.g. rare face-to-face contact with teachers and other students, online written assignments and online feedback replacing the face-to-face contact of the full-time students). The author shares her experience from the teaching of a one-term course of supervision at the master’s level of the Social Work part-time distance studies programme. The analysis of the students’ written reflections of the Balint supervision group session shows that, even within the above-mentioned form of education, it is possible to fulfil a specific level of the main supervision objectives. Some suggestions for optimizing this supervision method within the distance studies are presented in the conclusion.

This paper reports on a research project conducted with staff and students of a regional Australian university offering a qualifying Master of Social Work program through blended learning models. Underpinned by a framework of Appreciative Inquiry, the project employed focus groups and semi-structured interviews with staff and an online survey with students to identify issues of concern and to inform the redesign of course delivery. Pivotal to students’ experience was the need to create a sense of cohort to overcome perceptions of isolation and abandonment when subjects are delivered in distance modes rather than face to face. Moreover, inaccurate assumptions about postgraduate students’ familiarity with basic academic conventions and online teaching strategies were seen to contribute to a sense of personal failure and incompetence that could lead to withdrawal from the course. Strategies and processes introduced to address these matters are discussed and preliminary evaluations of their impact shared.

The TeSLA system proposes an innovative solution to guarantee correct authentication of students and to prove the authorship of their assessment tasks. Technologically, the system is based on the integration of five instruments: Face recognition, voice recognition, keystroke dynamics, forensic analysis, and plagiarism. The paper aims to analyze and compare the results achieved after the second pilot performed in an online and a blended university revealing the realization of trust-driven solutions for eAssessment.

As a type of interactive tool, many SPOC forums have stored rich textual data including focused learning content and feedback. However, currently, this information is used mainly for measuring students' activity levels instead of academic emotion and their evolutionary trends throughout a teaching period. This paper presents an unsupervised forum understanding model, namely the temporal emotion-topic model (TETM), to model time jointly with emotions and topics. This model is applied to track the evolutionary trends of pairs of {emotion, topic}, i.e., emot-topics. Especially, for each emotion, the most significant topic can be extracted and tracked across a semester. Finally, we investigate the emot-topics differences of different achievement levels of students, and examine the dynamics of emot-topics over course weeks to gain some insights about the relationship between time, emotion and learning achievement. The tracking of emot-topics could be valuable if users are informed of what students are concerned about and how these topics evolve in courses.

But assessment of the exercises is a very time-consuming task and due to the increasing number of students often even infeasible. Though programming exercises can be efficiently tested against expected output, the assessment systems often only deliver feedback regarding the correctness and sometimes additionally which test cases fail. But so far, these systems are not able to identify the reason for the error. Therefore, there should also be human tutors available with which students can discuss their solution and which can help them in identifying their misconceptions. In this paper, we describe the experiences we made when we introduced blended learning to our introductory programming course, which problems occurred, and how we plan to deal with the problems.

Prior to the Internet age, students had to study in isolation, and sit for summative assessments once or few times per course. Consequently, learners could rarely experience any kind of communication or collaboration, and student assessment was traditionally based on passing one or few exams. Despite lot of procedural enhancements, this delivery model had suffered from very weak results, and was applicable in limited number of subjects. With time, modern instructional design methodologies, multimedia critical thinking, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality were used to enhance the learner-content interaction and transform the learning experience to become more adaptive and personalized. Delivery models are becoming more collaborative and engaging, by utilizing new communication and conferencing tools, social media dynamics, user experience design and engagement trends. University structure and processes are being updated to cope with these new technological and methodological developments. Many brick-and-mortar universities started offering part of their courses or entire programs online, or in a blended format. More accredited virtual universities are becoming a serious alternative for prospective students, especially in crisis conditions and in under-developed regions. This chapter provides a brief overview of these international trends followed by an overview of the current status in the Arab world regarding Distance and Online Learning, highlighting current difficulties and impediments, future potentials and insights, the role of regulatory bodies, and the need to change. Some case studies of specific leading projects are explored, shedding the light on lessons learned from the field.

The Programme offers a means to re-establish their academic identities and develop new skills through participation in the learning activities and workshops provided on the Programme itself and through potential research collaborations with academics in universities in the UK. A key element is the training in English for Academic Purposes (EAP), which is delivered in weekly online lessons and intensive language workshops in Turkey. Both the online teaching and the workshops are staffed by volunteers working in language teaching and specifically in English for Academic Purposes. One of the core principles of this teaching is to pitch content in a way that is intellectually motivating and relevant in terms of the participants' academic identities, but scaffolded to take into account language proficiency levels, which can be as low as CEFR A1. Over the last eighteen months the technology, administrative structures, and language materials suitable for learners at all levels between A1 and C1 have been developed, and the process mapped to ensure sustainability.

The proposed FDI scheme is configured in series and parallel forms in the sense that in series form the decision on the occurrence of fault is made in FD module, and subsequently, the FI module coupled to the FD module will be activated for fault indication purposes. On the other hand, in parallel form a single module is employed for FDI purposes, simultaneously. In other words, two separate multiple-classifiers schemes are presented by using fourteen various statistical and non-statistical classification schemes. Furthermore, in this study, a novel ensemble classification scheme namely blended learning (BL) is proposed for the first time where single and boosted classifiers are blended as the local classifiers in order to enrich the classification performance. Single-classifier schemes are also exploited in FDI modules along with the ensemble-classifier methods for comparison purposes. In order to show the performance of proposed FDI method, it was also tested and validated on DAMADICS actuator system benchmark. Besides, comparative study with the related works done on this benchmark is provided to show the pros and cons of the proposed FDI method.

Data Sources/Review Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ERIC and PsycInfo were used to search for RCT's or quasi experimental studies conducted between 1979 and 9 June 2017, published in a peer reviewed journal in English. Results: Of 1592 studies, no RCT's specifically addressed the development of evidence based practice capabilities within the university teaching environment. Five quasi-experimental studies integrated blended learning, guided design processes, small group work, role play and structured debate into Masters of Nursing research courses. All five studies demonstrated some improvements in evidence based practice skills and/or research knowledge translation, with three out of five studies demonstrating significant improvements. Conclusions: There is a paucity of empirical evidence supporting the best strategies to use in developing evidence based practice skills and/or research knowledge translation skills for Master's Nursing students. As a profession, nursing requires methodologically robust studies that are discipline specific to identify the best approaches for developing evidence-based practice skills and/or research knowledge translation skills within the university teaching environment. Provision of these strategies will enable the nursing profession to integrate the best empirical evidence into nursing practice.

However, these scenarios are highly heterogeneous, and the varying data sources available in each particular context can condition the accuracy, relevance, in-terpretability and actionability of the Learning Analytics (LA) solutions, affecting also the user’s sense of agency and trust in such solutions. To aid stakeholders in making use of learning analytics, we propose a process to involve teachers in customizing multimodal LA (MMLA) solutions, adapting them to their particular blended learning situation (e.g., identifying relevant data sources and metrics). Since measuring the added value of adopting an LA solution is not straightforward, we also propose a concrete method for doing so. The results obtained from two case studies in authentic, blended computer-supported collaborative learning settings show an improvement in the sensitivity and F1 scores of the customized MMLA solution. Aside from these quantitative improvements, participant teachers reported both an increment in the effort involved, but also increased relevance, understanding and actionability of the results.

In the flipped classroom approach, students are encouraged to watch short video lectures as preparation for class, and classroom time is dedicated to more active forms of learning. In this editorial, we provide a thumbnail sketch of the origins and concept of the flipped classroom followed by a summary of the contributions to this special issue, which highlight the importance of considering a range of individual as well as contextual factors when implementing and evaluating the flipped classroom approach. Based on this observation, we propose and briefly discuss realist evaluation as a promising approach to evaluating educational interventions and for advancing our theoretical understanding of the flipped classroom. We argue that realist evaluation provides an analytical framework for posing the next generation of questions about the flipped classroom and we encourage scholars to address the questions: “How or why does the flipped classroom work, for whom, and in what circumstances?”.

This growth has created increasing challenges in offering one-size-fits-all CS1 courses. We found that non-CS majors' experiences and outcomes in our existing CS1 course were worse than those of intended CS majors. In response, we developed an introductory programming course, CS0.5, aimed at meeting the needs of the diverse population of non-CS major students interested in our courses. In this paper, we present the motivation, curriculum design, and evidence of effectiveness for this new course. We describe the specific design decisions we made in response to the experiences of non-CS majors in CS1. We also demonstrate that students' outcomes in CS0.5-measured in terms of students' pass rates, satisfaction, and attitudes-all not only improve compared to non-CS majors in CS1, but also largely match those of CS majors in CS1. Finally, we present student feedback, gathered through surveys and Appreciative Inquiry focus groups, that illustrates how our curriculum design choices better meet our non-major students' needs. The most-valued course design elements, as identified by focus group participants, provide insight for other CS educators who are designing similar courses.

In particular, the blended learning is considered a useful methodology for supporting and understanding students and their learning issues. Thanks to e-Learning platforms and their collaborative tools, students can interact with other students and share doubts on certain topics. However, teachers often remain outside of this process and do not understand the learning problems that are in their classrooms. A solution for ensuring the privacy of communication among students could be the adoption of a Sentiment Analysis methodology for the detection of the classroom mood during the learning process. In this paper, we investigate the adoption of a probabilistic approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as Sentiment Grabber. The proposed approach can detect the mood of students on the various topics and teacher can better tune his/her teaching approach. The proposed method has been tested in real cases with effective and satisfactory results.

The main objective in this study is to (a) map out retention for all the IOL courses, (b) compare retention on the same course delivered in three different modes; blended learning mode, distance learning mode, and self-directed mode, and (c) to investigate overall engagement patterns on IOL. The findings reveal low completion rates that vary by mode of delivery, identifying blended learning mode as most effective in retaining students. The results also reveal regular attrition patterns across all modes of delivery, with sharp drop-outs initially and concentrations of drop-outs at certain junctures in the courses. The drop-out patterns revealed in this study called for a re-evaluation of earlier parameters by which retention is measured, and especially what it means to ‘complete a course’. Instead of considering course completion in light of 100% coverage, the findings show considerably higher retention on IOL when the parameters for course completion are adjusted to for instance 90% coverage of course content.

All this time, in the face-to-face method of learning process, students have not been able to optimize the mastery of knowledge and skills as expected. One of the things that the Information Systems Study Program did to optimize said mastery is applying the blended learning program in e-Procurement courses. This study uses mixed method evaluation approach in evaluating various stages of the process to implement a blended learning program. Meanwhile, the evaluation method used consists of 2 parts of the model namely 1) CIPP, an evaluation carried out on context, input, process, and product, 2) The Flashlight Triad, an evaluation of activities that utilize information technology online. As the final result of evaluating the implementation of blended learning based on observations and research that has been done, there is an optimization of the increase in mastery of students' knowledge and skills, after conducting various activities that are conditioned on face-to-face activities combined with online ones. The results of this evaluation mean that a well-conditioned blended learning program can influence students in terms of motivation, therefore mastering the knowledge and skills of a course can be optimized through the student learning experience.

We report on a pilot study that evaluates design and implementation of a graduate blended-learning course in linguistics. For baseline data, teachers and students were surveyed to assess use and access to internet technologies. Taking as main reference the concept of community of inquiry, we designed and piloted an elective course on brain and language, which was evaluated in terms of the teaching, cognitive, and social presences in a community of inquiry and by using a student survey questionnaire. Results from the first survey show that most teachers are familiar with Moodle and that both groups make massive use of email. WhatsApp and blogs are seldom used, and massive open online courses (MOOCs) are unknown. The course evaluation evidenced tensions among the three presences, probably attributed to the pedagogic culture in the humanities. Students, although appreciative of the blended learning modality that allowed them constant access to the course and more comfortable studying timing, also value face-to-face sessions.

Its results, when adequately provided, can improve students’ learning. Assessment results could also be used to guide teachers in order to align their course design with the students’ results. However, the analysis of the assessment results and the extraction of useful conclusions for both teachers and students is not an easy task and computerized tools can be very helpful to provide automation of these processes. Moreover, the information regarding assessment of students can come from many sources and in the case of blended learning environments, the number of sources increases. In this paper, a system aimed at supporting Competence-based Learning in blended learning environments (COBLE) is presented. The paper presents the system’s architecture and its main elements.

As one central advantage, virtual mobility enables international and intercultural experiences for non-traditional students regularly found in distance education. However, hitherto there is a lack of empirical data on the students' experiences with virtual mobility. Moreover, adequate teaching methods and course designs have to be identified which stimulate the students' learning motivation and learning success. This article addresses these challenges by presenting results from a joint blended learning course of two distance universities. Constructive alignment was used to implement virtual mobility and digital storytelling. The evaluation of the course demonstrates that the students generally value the opportunity for virtual mobility but likewise appreciate face-to-face contact. It also stresses the importance of suitable teaching methods and adequate course designs to spur the students' collaboration and to achieve the intended learning outcomes.

These courses are available and give 10 study points (equal European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System’s european credit points (ECTS)). In these courses, different techniques and approaches have been used, like blended learning, flipped classroom and ordinary lectures. Some of the courses use case work as a part of the pedagogical approach. The cases the students use are developed by the students themselves and they use cases from their own work place. The paper presents the results from a round of interviews that were undertaken with the students. The reasoning for asking the students to choose a case from their own work place is twofold. First, it is to tie the curriculum to a work situation and thereby obtain a relevance for the course back to the work place. Second, it is to enhance the learning outcome from the courses as students are then able to use their own backgrounds to write and analyse the cases. The students are asked about the learning outcome in the courses with the real-life cases, compared to the courses where they have no case work. Our aim is to establish if there is a link between using real-life cases and enhanced relevance and achievement of learning outcomes.

More specifically, it focuses on the analysis of two individual universities: the University of Tasmania, in Australia; and the Federal University of Parana, in Brazil. They are both public and mostly face-to-face universities trying to engage with OEP to enhance their blended learning offerings, and more generally learning and teaching. However, these institutions are distinctive in terms of their student numbers, their blended learning approaches, their role within their own communities, and their OEP strategies and initiatives. We will present some of the key policies and strategies adopted by these universities to support OEP, as well as the impact and the opportunities at present. The discussion in this paper will then attempt to make some recommendations for future directions of OEP adoption not only in these two countries, but also elsewhere.

Based on much of the current scholarship in applied BL research, current trial and error efforts to improve learning in these new settings are falling short of leading the way to program development. Scholars have argued that such small-scale initiatives fail to provide the basis for a much needed and explicit e-learning theory that institutions can apply on a more general scale. To respond to this call, we report on a two-year longitudinal study we conducted at the micro (student and instructor), meso (Director and coordinator) and macro (institutional) levels of a BL program in a large private-for-profit university in Chile. Convinced of the importance of adopting a sociocultural perspective to move towards e-learning change, our focus was particularly on the perspectives of the BL players at all three levels-and the identities they were mediating. Using a grounded theory methodology within the qualitative research paradigm and an iterative approach to the research design, data was collected and analyzed at all three levels. Data sources involved questionnaires, individual and focus group interviews, field observations, policy documents and reflective journals. The most salient understandings uncovered from the inquiries revealed strengths and gaps in terms of community building, collaborative learning and self-directedness – the essence of any successful learning environment. These findings suggest a practical framework for supporting BL program design and innovation across a plethora of contexts and institutions and we believe bring us a step closer to e-learning theory development.

It has been considered as a critical professional requirement in educational system since it to a great extent affects students’ learning. However, research has shown that both pre-service and in-service teachers are weak in assessment literacy and lack confidence to implement effective assessment. The main reasons of unsatisfactory assessment literacy among teachers are the limited pre-service assessment education and a lack of research on the pedagogies on assessment education. To enrich effective practice of assessment literacy education, a blended deep learning approach for educating teacher assessment literacy was applied in this study. The strategy combined a face-to-face component for content-based teaching and an online learning component for process-based teaching. The online learning component with the focus on peer assessment engaged participants in a deep learning of assessment. Participants expressed that they had obtained an in-depth understanding on assessment literacy and particularly on peer assessment. They had developed better confidence and are willing to implement peer assessment in their future teaching. This study provides a case of using a blended learning approach on assessment education for reference.

It reveals the need for precise rules adapted to the advances in technology, if the process of digitalisation in higher education (HE) is not to come to a halt. If HE institutions are to act as centres of innovation with respect to the implementation of digital teaching and learning formats, then structural and strategic positioning with regard to e-and blended learning above all is called for in addition to financial resources, as well as the distribution and sustainable incorporation of digital offerings in faculties and HE institutions. There is a great deal of insecurity however with respect to the legal framework requirements and how best to count digital teaching towards one’s own teaching load. This results to some extent from the complexity of current laws and regulations partially overtaken by didactic and methodological changes in education, with decentralised educational federalism only adding to the complexity. Bearing in mind teaching and learning formats that are undergoing change or have already been transformed, ways of adapting the (legal) framework to the digital shift need to be found, last but not least in order to offer enthusiastic teaching staff incentives to develop and expand digital formats.

This study focuses on the problematic of learning in architectural design education process and examines its components. The relationship between learning and perception and how it can be handled in the architectural environment is discussed. Answers are searched on the axis of ""individual, experience, perception"" and especially is focused the concept of ""filtering"". The learning environment in the architectural design studio is seen as a cultural environment where all actors share their experiences. It is thought that these variables should be brought to the forefront in order not to lose the originality, with so many variables connected with these cultural actors. In this context, it is aimed to examine the relation between filtering and authenticity in the process of debating the problem of learning in working. The discussion was conducted through a blended learning environment that is supposed to support the aforementioned relationship. The study is based on the constructing grounded theory as a qualitative research pattern. The dynamic structure that can be empowered by the field experience of the selected research pattern has been a driving force in the study. Temporary hypotheses were identified with the preliminary problems and conceptual samples that were expected to be discussed, and then an experience environment was created that could generate data for the study. Then an experience environment was created that could generate data for the work. The implications of the observations, the openended questionnaires and the process of making the interviews were evaluated by descriptive analysis. With this approach, problems can be observed on an individual basis; and some of the problems that were grounded were brought into questionable positions with the architectural design studio.

A total of more than 2500 students attended the course during 2015 and 2016. We used a gamification environment within the Moodle e-learning platform during the course. Gamification steps included a reward system, alternative learning paths, various feedback options and social interaction platforms. Course quality was assessed based on students’ willingness to participate in voluntary on-line tests, completion and results of final exams, as well as results of student satisfaction surveys. Our results indicate that gamification is able to improve IT course quality though it cannot solve all possible problems arising during such courses.

We describe the process of blended learning through a teaching experiment which offers a good reference to teachers. We then describe how this model can be carried out in a network environment efficiently. The experimental results show that visual learning in a network environment can improve the learning effect, which promotes students’ learning from passive to active and leads to a better communication and reflection. This study also shows the effects on improving teachers’ professional development. One aim of this study is to develop students’ 4C (Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Collaboration, Communication and Creativity) abilities through a series of activities both offline and online. The other aim is to enrich the theory of visual learning based on network environment and to implement the application of visual technology and the concept of personalized learning into practical teaching.

Our main assumption is that young adults are inclined to improve their foreign language skills by accessing virtual learning platforms as this experience is emphasizing their need to belong to online learning communities. This study begins with a critical approach of recent trends in learning/ teaching methods in the field of foreign languages. We will mention some successful blended learning strategies for the acquisition and assessment of foreign languages, but we will also pinpoint the limits of such methods. We will then provide a short overview of previous research in this domain conducted in Romania with a focus on the Bucharest University of Economic Studies' efforts to include an online component in its teaching activities. Our subsequent analytic section will be constructed on data gathered through a survey conducted in 2016 with tertiary learners from different Romanian academic centers. We will show that by drawing the profile of the 21st century foreign language online learner, we can make informed suggestions for updating foreign language teaching methods. Our main purpose is to predict fresh interactive techniques that could appeal more to students in our domain of interest. We will show that such up-to-date methods can improve not only students' results in foreign language learning but they can also provide an additional environment where students can make independent learning choices. We will also address the limits of our study and possible subsequent directions of research in order to gather more data that could supplement our initial findings.

However, despite the efforts done by English for Law Purposes teachers, students still have language difficulties in general and are not able to comprehend texts related to their specialty in specific. Two main reasons are at the source of this problem: the limited instruction time and students’ lack of motivation. Hence, this paper reports on an experimental study undertaken with nineteen 1st year law Master’s students who have learned English for at least 10 years and whose proficiency level is estimated to be intermediate. The experiment consisted in teaching them English using the blended approach via a Moodle platform. This ELP blended course based on Content and Language Integrated Learning approach, aimed to develop their reading comprehension. The results showed that this teaching approach was interesting at two levels. First, it allowed students’ exposure to a wide variety of law texts and related activities in spite of the low time load allocated to English teaching. Second, it raised students’ motivation as they could have access to many activities in their free time, select the ones to deal with, have feedback and discuss their difficulties with their mates or their instructor. Moreover, findings revealed that students involved in the experiment obtained higher scores in reading tests than the students who were not. The main conclusion drawn is that the blended approach combined with CLIL helped ELP students to develop their content knowledge and improve their reading competence in a short span of time.

With a theoretical point of departure from Dewey and a methodological point of departure from netnography, this study focused on a blended learning module at Aalborg University, where teaching is based on PBL. A primary research question was investigated: “How can IT support collaborative learning among learner communities in a PBL Master’s program at Aalborg University?” The ways teachers and groups of students could benefit from utilizing IT as a platform for learning were examined. Netnography was the chosen methodology, and the data consisted of the course materials, the reflections, and the dialogues available online. The study showed that including more students allows for more discussions and reflections than including fewer students given teachers describe the task thoroughly and support the online dialogue. In addition, online collaboration allows students to return to the dialogue and re-use it as a resource for their dissertations, teachers can benefit from the online reflections and discussions to improve the educational design of the course, and researchers can obtain rich data from online reflections and dialogues.

Engineering education demands active and experiential learning for experiencing demonstrable technical and professional skills. The practice of active learning strategies is gaining momentum in Indian engineering education. Engaging today’s learners i.e. Millennial learners, in learning activities, is a challenging task for a teacher in a constrained physical learning environment. The responsibility of the teacher is to create an effective learning environment to promote students’ intended learning. The learning environment is characterized by the learners, learning activities and learning outcomes. This paper presents a different kind of an experience gained in creating an effective learning environment in Engineering Graphics course for the first year (freshman) engineering students for improving their spatial visualization. This also portrays a variety of blended learning activities employed in building confidence amongst students. The learning strategies have been developed to overcome the challenges so as to create an effective learning environment among students. While employing such learning approaches, the factors like engaging students, using appropriate strategies, balancing the content length with the level of learning, managing time and infrastructure, and measuring the of success of activity should be considered. These well-structured activities are executed with the appropriate supportive learning resources. The impact of blended teaching strategies and their sequence on improving students’ learning in this course has also been assessed through structured feedback and informal interactions. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in students’ learning experience through a set of active learning strategies.

This CAD course aims at lifting as many students as possible to a preferably high and well-defined level of competence. At the same time, the teacher's workload can be kept within limits that allow him or her to spend the majority of his or her capacity on supporting the individual student. In order to reach this aim in spite of common unfavourable teaching conditions a complex pedagogical concept of individual learning in large groups has been developed. Key elements of this concept are the following: - Building up and maintaining the student´s motivation by teamwork - Ensuring favourable conditions for a successful teaching performance inside teamwork - Orientating knowledge transfer at the storage system of the human brain - Clearly defining content and aimed at level of competence - Presenting contents and methods via hands-on projects to be performed in teamwork - Systematically addressing geometrical topics at optimal stages [1] - Using videos to convey principles, content and methods - Utilizing a graded system of exercises for building up individual competence in all teams - Employing a comprehensive system of individual support for the students inside teamwork - Using teamwork for all individual learning phases This course has already been carried out several times with great success and has been further optimized.

This need is particularly evident in educational contexts where the interplay between community processes and dialogical construction of identity leads to intersubjectivity as a notion linking Dialogical Self Theory and the Theory of Communities of Practice. This link is converted in a new methodological approach, suitable to investigate identity construction in the interpersonal relationships of communities and different kinds of learning communities. This chapter proposes a device that makes the positioning construct operational through the joint use of two tools, Positioning Network Analysis and discursive reformulation. Positioning Network Analysis qualitatively employs Social Network Analysis to identify the positioning of individual participants and whole community. Discursive reformulation is an interpretive movement by which the speaker dialogically constructs his or her own position by rewording others’ statements. An integrated use of Positioning Network Analysis and discursive reformulation provides a static and dynamic picture of the dialogical construction of identity in communities of practice, with this article providing a research example of this twofold device on three blended learning communities. The correlation between specific categories of positioning and reformulation marks the in-depth nature of this device, whose use in educational contexts could prove helpful in promoting experiences of action-research.

However, these skills are failed in most of courses mainly for specific topics like crowded classroom, absence of professor/student contact and motivation, professor as the main protagonist of learning. To provide the desired above skills necessary for success in the chemical engineering fields, several pedagogical approaches can be used in order to avoid the cited problems. Flipped classroom is the methodology that reverses the logical of classroom. Student’s access theoretical content at home and in the classroom take the time to discuss the subject, solve problems and projects with the teacher’s help. In flipped classroom, the live class lectures are replaced by on-line videos or research or reading at home. Therefore, the classroom becomes a dynamic and interactive learning environment. The student turn into the protagonist of learning. In this way, the use of the flipped classroom was evaluated for the first time in the Mass Balance classes of Chemical Engineering Course at Federal University of Ceara, Brazil. The aim our study was to examine the effectiveness of the flipped classroom in learning basic concepts about mass balance. So, we prepared videos about the content, containing the basic concepts, examples of application and resolution of exercises. At home, the students also answer on-line quizzes containing theoretical questions about classes. In the classroom, the students used the time to solve problems and projects guided by the teacher. To measure the complete understanding of the subject-matter learning, we promote an exam based on the mass balance problems typical of chemical engineering process. The obtained results demonstrate that active learning flipped classroom promoted a better understanding of the content, with consolidation of the basic concepts, besides reducing the time needed to understand the subject addressed in the classes as compared with traditional classes.

The issue related to communicative skills development is being discussed in different countries throughout the world. This problem is faced by university graduates from Europe, the US and Russia, and in the East. The learning process exploits a variety of electronic platforms, which, on the one hand, significantly increase the pool of students, but, on the other hand, hinder the development of communicative skills. This poses the question about blended learning which combines active and interactive teaching methods with e-learning. Consider a good example of these two types of combined student activity obtained using interactive methods in the Moodle course “Professional training in English” designed for the Bachelor's Degree Programs, Tomsk Polytechnic University (Tomsk, Russia). This paper considers the main types of tasks used in the e-course. It is shown that the teacher's first aim is to be not a scientific knowledge translator, but to foster a creative educational environment by selecting an optimal teaching strategy through modern educational technology; an e-course is a good teaching aid to build hard and soft skills.

Nepal’s Government recognized the need to sustain competence with continuous professional development and to upgrade 6-month trained working AAs to professional equivalence with the new national standard of 12-month training. As they are essential district health workers and AA clinical training sites are full, an innovative distance blended learning, competency-based, upgrade 1-year course was developed and conducted in 2014–2017 for two batches. Methods: The course content was developed over 18 months by a team of Nepali and overseas AA training experts. The 1-year course started with a refresher course, continued with tablet-based 12-month self-learning modules and clinical case logs, regular educational mentor communication, midcourse 2-week contact time in an AA training site, regular text messaging and ended with clinical examination and multiple-choice questions. Tablet content included 168 new case studies, pre- and posttests, video lectures, matching exercises and a resource library. All module work and logged clinical cases were uploaded centrally, where clinical mentors were able to review work. Clinical skills were upgraded, as needed, through direct clinical contact midway through the course. Quantitative and qualitative course assessments were included. Results: Fourteen working AAs in first batch and eight working AAs in second batch from district, zonal and mission hospitals across Nepal were enrolled. All remained working at their hospitals throughout the course, and there were no significant tablet problems inhibiting course completion. Twenty-one AAs completed all modules successfully with time required for module completion averaging 19.2 h (range 11.2–32). One AA left the course after 3 months with a personal problem. Subjectively, AAs felt that the obstetric and pediatric modules were more difficult; lowest marks were objectively seen in the airway module. Clinical mentors averaged 8.2 h mentoring review work per module with direct student communication of 2.9 h per module per month. Participants logged a total of 5473 clinical cases, ranging between 50 and 788 cases each. Complications were recorded; outcomes were good. Challenges were the national IT infrastructure making data synchronization difficult and the lack of clinical exposure at some AA’s hospitals. Nineteen AAs attended the final examination, and all passed. Two AAs withdrew before the final examination period due to personal and logistic reasons. Conclusion: This is the first use of distance blended learning to upgrade district health workers in Nepal and perhaps for non-doctor anesthesia providers globally. Key success factors were motivated students, cultural and contextualized clinical content, good educational mentoring relationships with regular communication, central IT and motivational support, and face-to-face midcourse clinical contact time.

However, to result in a successful learning experience, they often require teachers to spend a significant amount of time. This article reports about how lab courses can be implemented for efficiently supporting learners while significantly reducing the workload of teachers. The presented iLab concept consists of a blended learning teaching methodology and the labsystem eLearning platform that was especially designed for supporting the teaching methodology. Applying the concept results in students and teachers not having to spend time on surrounding tasks that produce overhead, but instead being able to focus on learning and teaching. The iLab concept enables teaching more content in less time. It especially reduces the workload on teachers, making lab courses scale. The iLab concept shows very good learning results with more than 1500 students between 2004 and 2017. The iLab concept was originally developed for teaching students about computer networks and distributed systems. In the meantime, it was successfully used in other domains such as training future teachers.

Firstly, lecture-style teaching was conducted with presentation slides in order to explain the contents of a textbook. Secondly, students were required to do exercises and quizzes. By using the last eight weeks, they were asked to create presentation slides outside a class to introduce the up-to-date topics on artificial intelligence. These slides were mutually evaluated among them so that they developed their own slides based on the feedback before the tenth week of the course for the second round of mutual evaluations. Questionnaires concerning students' understanding technical terms of the field and consciousness-raising towards competence were also conducted before and after the programs. The learning effects of a module in 'AI Technology' are compared with my previous research outcome of the module, 'Artificial Intelligence'. This paper reports their results.

A model was developed to assist lecturers, especially those that are new to the profession, to use a blended approach to design meaningful learning interventions for physiology. The aim of the model is to encourage methodical development of learning interventions, while the purpose is to provide conceptual and communication tools that can be used to develop appropriate operational learning interventions. A whole brain approach that encourages challenging the four quadrants is encouraged. The main arguments of the model are to first determine the learning task requirements, as these will inform the design and development of learning interventions to facilitate learning and the assessment thereof.

The changes of emotional aspects due to student's individual characteristics were also analysed. Participants were surveyed twice during the course, using the metrics mentioned above, and their emotional and cognitive changes were evaluated. The number of valid participants was 54. Scores of metrics between the two surveys were compared. Though most scores for self-efficacy and self assessment decreased, this suggests that participants recognised their actual learning situation well. The relationship between the metrics and student’s characteristics was examined. To illustrate participant’s emotional and cognitive changes, causal analysis was introduced. The relationships between scores for self-efficacy and self evaluation in the two surveys were analysed and compared. Also, the impact of improvements in note-taking skills on changes in self-efficacy and self-evaluation were examined using causal analyses. These results show that note-taking activities significantly stimulated the level of self-efficacy and self-assessment when the lecturer’s instructions were able to improve note-taking skills factor scores during the course.

This research showed how users interact with e-learning websites and indicated the patterns that can be used as standard guidelines to design the best e-learning websites. It was found localisation of e-learning websites was scarce and slow interaction with e-learning websites has inconvenienced users. Additionally, too many web objects on the user interface of e-learning websites have a tendency to confuse users. A mixed method approach was used I this study, namely content analysis (qualitative) and localisation (quantitative). Thus, this research contributes to knowledge by guiding users on localising their web objects according to their preferences and hopefully allow for an easy and quick information search for e-learning websites.

To achieve this goal, this study developed a gamified platform and a blended learning curriculum. During an 18-week experimental instruction period, a series of instructional activities, which included online discussions as well as classroom lectures and discussions, were conducted to enhance 32 journalism students' critical-thinking dispositions and skills. Repeated measure analysis of variance on test scores and analyses of open questions found that the participants significantly improved their critical thinking skills and dispositions through the gamified platform with the experimental instruction in a blended learning environment. The findings suggest that providing clear goals, challenges and quests, feedback, competition and cooperation, actual grading and visible status, access/ unlocking content, onboarding time restrictions, freedom of choice, and new identities and roles, as well as avoidance of over-justification, contributes to achieving a ""meaningful gamification"" experience, which may further lead to self-determined learning in critical thinking.

The educational technology combined teacher dashboards (extracted analytics) and class and individually paced assignments (embedded analytics). The results indicated that children in the LA-ET condition made significantly more progress on arithmetic skills in one schoolyear compared to children in the paper & pencil condition.

Yet these variables may influence students' instructional outcomes. In this paper, we introduce the Spatial Classroom Log Explorer (SPACLE): a prototype tool that facilitates the rapid discovery of relationships between withinsoftware and out-of-software events. Unlike previous tools for retrospective analysis, SPACLE replays moment-by-moment analytics about student and teacher behaviors in their original spatial context. We present a data analysis workflow using SPACLE and demonstrate how this workflow can support causal discovery. We share the results of our initial replay analyses using SPACLE, which highlight the importance of considering spatial factors in the classroom when analyzing ITS log data. We also present the results of an investigation into the effects of studentteacher interactions on student learning in K-12 blended classrooms, using our workflow, which combines replay analysis with SPACLE and causal modeling. Our findings suggest that students' awareness of being monitored by their teachers may promote learning, and that ""gaming the system"" behaviors may extend outside of educational software use.

The challenging anatomy and physiology in ENT is considered particularly suitable for self-assessed and adaptive e-learning. Usage and data on daily experience with e-learning in German ENT-university hospitals are currently unavailable and the degree of implementation of blended learning including feed-back from medical students are currently not known. We investigated the current need and usage of e-learning in academic ENT medical centers in Germany. We surveyed students and chairs for Otorhinolaryngology electronically and paperbased during the summer semester 2015. Our investigation revealed an overall heterogenous picture on quality and quantity of offered e-learning applications. While the overall amount of e-learning in academic ENT in Germany is rather low, at least half of the ENT-hospitals in medical faculties reported that e-learning had improved their own teaching activities. More collaboration among medical faculties and academic ENT-centers may help to explore new potentials, overcome technical difficulties and help to realize more ambitious projects.

Information technology offers the tools to design and develop effective and more efficient training. The aims of this thesis were: 1) Compare the effectiveness of blended versus classroom training for the acquisition of knowledge; 2) Investigate the effectiveness and critical design features of serious games for performance improvement and motivation. Methods: Five empirical studies were conducted to answer the research questions and a descriptive study on an evaluation framework to assess serious games was performed. Results: The results of the research studies indicated that: 1) For knowledge acquisition, blended learning is equally effective and attractive for learners as classroom learning; 2) A serious game with realistic, interactive cases improved complex cognitive skills for residents, with limited self-study time. Although the same game was motivating for inexperienced medical students and stimulated them to study longer, it did not improve their cognitive skills, compared with what they learned from an instructional e‑module. This indicates an ‘expertise reversal effect’, where a rich learning environment is effective for experts, but may be contra-productive for novices (interaction of prior knowledge and complexity of format). Discussion: A blended design is equally effective and attractive as classroom training. Blended learning facilitates adaptation to the learners’ knowledge level, flexibility in time and scalability of learning. Games may support skills learning, provided task complexity matches the learner’s competency level.

Automatic judgement-based online judge system is both suitable for exploration learning and for collaborative learning. This paper uses the principle of blended learning and proposes a set of blended learning modes which combine online judge with computer programming courses. The paper first describes design ideas of the blended learning mode in a learning environment, resource, learning content and form and learning evaluation. Then the author takes C programming language course as an example to elaborate practical measures of the blended learning. Finally, the comparative experiments show that the application of the mode has improved significantly in the knowledge points, the amount of code and test scores of students than traditional methods. The application of the blended learning model based on an online judge system in programming courses plays a positive role to students' programming, logical thinking, research and innovation capabilities.

To ensure quality blended learning programmes, it is essential that teachers developing blended learning courses are trained, particularly in relation to applied methodology. To understand how best to implement blended learning at the teacher trainer college extensive research was carried out, the findings of which were made available to the University’s teachers in the form of a content-based, yet hands-on blended training programme with TPack as its exit point. The student results showed a marked improvement when following a blended learning course developed by teachers who were trained in the programme as compared to blended learning courses developed by non-trained teachers, In addition, the results of the blended courses (which were developed by trained teachers) showed a vast improvement of the non-blended courses, it’s so called ‘regular’ variant.

How can faculty be inspired to move away from the traditional course toward offering high quality blended learning opportunities for their students? Penn State University's Teaching and Learning with Technology (TLT) unit's solution is the Blended Learning Transformation (BlendLT) program;a systemic approach, which integrates change by combining targeted professional development with sustained instructional design support and clearly documented evidence of success. Blended learning is fast becoming the preferred method for transforming residential courses from traditional instruction to engaging learning experiences (Moskal, Dziuban, & Hartman 2013). Yet despite the interest in blended learning, it can be challenging to get faculty to create a blended course (Berrett, 2012). By embedding instructional designers into a blended learning faculty development program, and providing research support to gather evidence and measure success, Penn State University's TLT unit offers a three-pronged approach to creating blended learning courses. The three elements of the Blended Learning Transformation program include: 1. Targeted professional development provided as a blended learning course, which takes place over approximately eight weeks, 2. Integrated instructional design support provided during the professional development course and sustained throughout the phases of completed course redesign and first course offering, 3. Results shared through documenting demonstrated evidence of success as related to course learning outcomes. This paper provides an overview ofthe BlendLT program, describes in detail the BlendLT professional development course, discusses the role ofthe instructional designer in BlendLT, provides guidelines and samples for evidence of success, and shares descriptive data and case based scenarios on courses included in BlendLT",blended learning;course revision;faculty development;instructional design,curricula;e-learning;professional aspects;teaching;blended learning;course revision;faculty development;instructional designs;integrated instructional designs;professional development;professional development courses;traditional instruction;education,"Berrett, D., How 'flipping' the classroom can improvethetraditional lecture (2012) The Chronicle of Higher Education, , http://moodle.technion.ac.il/file.php/1298/Announce/HowFlippingtheClassroomCanImprovetheTraditionalLecture.pdf; Graham, C.R., Dziuban, C.D., Core research and issues related to blended learning environments (2008) Handbook Ofresearch on Educational Communications and Technology (3rd Ed.), , J.M.

This chapter aims to review the advantages, disadvantages and distinctive contribution of different learning modes and media. It provides some simple principles and frameworks for thinking about the sorts of blends that work well for different purposes, people and contexts. The chapter highlights the significance of the shift to independent learning that a blended approach often enables and stimulates. ‘Blended learning’ refers to a mix of online and more traditional components, be they face-to-face events, books or workplace-based projects. In this context the electronic or online components may still make up much of the course or programme - or their contribution may be more limited. When it comes to picking and mixing different media or modes of learning, some of the relevant considerations are pretty straightforward.

This training implements and cognitive, communication, developmental, and socio-orientation tasks, as it allows the students to form important behavioral benchmarks -Active and conscious position in the community, the adoption of the rules of the hostel and interaction, willingness to help, finding constructive solutions to situations of interpersonal communication, which ultimately provides the optimal socialization of the individual in society",blended learning;distance learning;e-learning;interactive learning;learning using interactive media,,"Andreev, A., Educational-methodical complex for e-Learning (2007) Higher Education in Russia, (7), pp. 65-69; Brown, A., Bimrose, J., Innovative educational technologies (problems of practical use) (2007) Higher Education in Russia, (4), p. 30; Carliner, S., (2004) An Overview of Online Learning, p. 229. , 2nd ed., Amherst: HRD Press Inc; (2012) The Departmental Target Program for the Introduction of E-learning and Distance Education Technologies in the Regional General Education System for 2012-2015, p. 46. , Committee of Education and Science of Kursk region. . .

It will discuss the conceptualization of ‘DNR’ (Death Notification with Responsibility), a blended learning course for police students in Germany which focuses on the administering of death notifications according to both professional and legal requirements, reacting flexibly and compassionately to the needs of the bereaved. DNR has two main aims: (1) the imparting of crucial factual knowledge, and (2) the creation of opportunities for intensified reflexive and participatory learning. The concept combines classroom-based learning with e-learning modules. E-learning components allow students to engage with the sensitive issue of death notification at their own pace; when and where they feel comfortable. The overall course objectives are complicated by the police’s hierarchical organizational structure, as well as the preference of experience-based, on-the-job learning, and a general mistrust towards ‘academization’ of police education in Germany.

The reflection presented in this paper focus on different learning experiences, special on gamification and how it can make learning and evaluation enjoyable. We implement a new learning environment on higher education. Instead of using the time in-class for lectures we gave online lectures to the students using videos, social network, webinars and interactive e-contents and use the time in-class to promote debates, synchronous communication with students from Portugal and Brazil and other interactive learning activities. In each class we also promote learning activities based on the gamification theory. In this article we present a learning model that we are using in our institution that combines face to face sessions and online sessions in a global higher education environment.

Yet, the path from traditional to blended learning, albeit less daunting, is not without its challenges and pitfalls, especially in institutions in evolving countries where both teachers and learners are struggling to adopt new ways of thinking about learning per se, let alone online. The aim of this research was to explore the nature of the challenges faced in blended programs at a large private university in Chile and at a military university in the Czech Republic. Our focus was primarily on engagement and investment in sustained use of the platforms, provided as part of EFL programs in these countries. We sought to unravel the interest and activity in the 'blended' part of these programs on the part of teachers and students in both sites as a means of mediating understanding internationally of ways to enhance the respective course offerings and the quality of the learning experiences for all participants in these programs. The Qualitative 6-month Action research is grounded inthe literature on investment and agency and the symbiotic roles of teacher and learners that result when these constructs are integral to the pedagogy in online spaces. Analysis ofthe rich data collected with ethnographic tools combined with the statistical data from tracking of platform traffic, underscores the importance of building Communities of Inquiry among teachers, administrators and learners to address the challenges that arise in blended learning spaces. The findings clearly indicate the universality of issues yet that the need for unique responses at the classroom level is critical for sustained engagement and learning",agency;blended learning;communities of inquiry;student/teacher roles;sustained investment,e-learning;investments;learning systems;students;teaching;advanced technology;agency;blended learning;building community;face-to-face education;higher education institutions;learning experiences;sustained investment;education,"Anderson, T., Social software to support distance education learners (2011) The Theory and Practice Ofonline Learning, pp. 221-244. , T.

The promises behind MOOCs stand on delivering free and open education to the public, as well as training a large criterion of students. However, MOOCs clashes severely with students dropout which by then forced educationalists to deeply think of MOOCs effectivity from all angles. As a result, the authors of this paper propose a pedagogical idea that strongly depends on injecting the online learning (MOOC) with face-to-face sessions to refresh the students minds as well as integrating them in the real learning process.

The paper presents the design and evaluation of an online decision support tool for assessment design, which was developed on a collaborative project across Indian and European universities. The tool was designed based on a shared framework of design and assessment principles which took account of the purpose of the assessment, knowledge and skills to be assessed and how and by whom the assessment was to be conducted. The tool was not intended to provide definitive advice but rather to support the decision-making process and professional development of teachers. This support would be provided during the use of the tool and as a summary at the end of the teacher’s consultation with the tool. Overall, users were satisfied with the tool, as the data show, and were positive about using it in designing assessment. Recommendations that were made during the evaluation, for redeveloping the tool to make it more suitable for a wider audience are discussed.

In addition for engineers, the rapidly changing world brings the need to engage students in diverse learning. Wageningen University & Research is experiencing these trends. It tackles them with outcomes-based teaching and engaging students within a rich setting of blended learning. The resulting education programmes are rated as the best in the national surveys of the last twelve years. This paper describes how to design such blended learning courses based on literature. It also reflects the experience of Wageningen University & Research with its successful approach. The prerequisites for course design are a well-constructed curriculum and properly formulated Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs). The core of course design consists of selecting and combining different types of online and on-campus Teaching and Learning Activity's (TLAs). Generally a smart design of a combination of (many) types of TLAs is needed to create top-quality blended engineering courses. Student motivation and higher level Intended Learning Outcomes for engineering require rich on-campus TLAs that cannot be completely offered online",course design;diversity;online,curricula;students;teaching;technical presentations;course design;diversity;education programmes;intended learning outcomes;online;student motivation;teaching and learning;wageningen university;education,"Biggs, J.B., Tang, C., (2011) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, p. 480. , 4th Revised edition ed.

In order to explore what happens in such blended learning experience, there is a need for multiple data sources that bring evidence from these different spaces. The present proceedings bring together two workshops co-located at the Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK'17) conference in Vancouver (Canada): the 2nd Cross-LAK and the 6th Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) workshop. The two workshops tackled the analysis of this complexity, from complementary perspectives. Our aim is to promote dialogue and the alignment of these research efforts across both subcommunities. Moreover, this collaboration is the seed of a Special Interest Group (SIG) that will be part of the Society of Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR). The goal of this SIG will be to advance the understanding of the learning process no matter where and how it happens.

More and more teaching functions can be implemented via this platform. Hence, an online teaching platform with complete teaching functions becomes an essential development trend in the whole higher educational mode. Based on connectivism theory, multimedia real- time storage technology and five-dimensional evaluation model of blended learning, a MOOC platform of Modern Educational Technology was constructed in this paler by combining multimedia resource storage technology. Besides, the design was implemented from 2 parts: functional structure of the platform and each module of the platform. Meanwhile, the effect of the MOOC platform was tested through five-dimensional evaluation model of blended learning from three aspects: learning attitude, learning process and learning effect. Results demonstrate that the score of participation degree is 4.94, interaction degree is 2.14, fitness is 4.13, satisfaction is 4.29 and effect degree is 4.375.

This study examined one way to encourage further student participation in online discussions. of specific importance was how to encourage students to read their student-colleagues’ online discussion responses: not just a minimum number of responses but the majority of the responses. Results illustrate that the method utilized, Thematic Analysis, is effective in increasing reading rates among students. But possibly even more interesting are the students’ reports that the use of this learning tool encouraged them to think critically and that their learning occurred primarily through many of the tenets of social constructivist theory.

This transformative work has resulted in a significant increase in laboratory capacity, thus reducing the need for repeating classes. The integrated platform offers students both hands-on experience using real equipment, and the convenience of easy setup and reconfiguration using simulators. An example practical exercise in setting up an OSPF/BGP network is presented to illustrate the experimental design before and after the integration of GNS3 simulators. In summary, we describe the infrastructure, the integrated platform and systems, network design and experiment design; and the learning and teaching experiences of using GNS3 in classes.

This teaching technique typically uses some form of online instruction and is common in secondary and postsecondary academic settings. When the librarians at St. Michael's Hospital Library at the University of Toronto implemented the flipped classroom model, they found that this methodology can work in a variety of contexts, including library information literacy instruction at an academic hospital library. Using the Springshare LibGuides as a platform to deliver the preworkshop content, the librarians created websites that contained instructional videos, text, and sample exercises that learners were asked to engage with before coming to the in-class workshop. The in-class workshop then focused on reviewing the sample exercises and answering learners' questions.

The course was taught using open distance learning (ODL) methods during 2012 to 2014. Developing teaching and learning materials using technology requires different modes of delivery and requires unique approaches to pedagogy compared to traditional quality assurance delivery. This study explores strategies applied by ODL lecturers in the designing and communication of the course to optimise student engagement and scores. The quantitative data consisted of all students in the 2012-2014 and 2015 years of study. The 2012-2014 scores were attained by teaching using ODL methods only. The 2015 teaching was performed using a blended learning approach. The qualitative data consisted of a random sample of 10 students in the 2015 year of study. The results indicate a trend of improvement of scores from 2012-2014 to 2015. They improved from 38%, 36% and 57% during 2012-2014 to 84% in 2015. Qualitative analysis suggests some specific strategies employed impacted on the 2015 scores.

This report is dedicated to a software and hardware complex used for university students training related to their further work in physical experiments. An important feature of this project is a combination of hands-on and virtual practicum approach. In this approach students work with real physical equipment and software complex to study the electronics and data acquisition system of the LIS experiment [1]. A new approach for conceptualization and skills development in scientific and engineering project work is proposed. In this computer-based approach libraries of various components of nuclear physics experiment (radioactive sources, various types of detectors, instruments and components of nuclear electronics) are used. This is different from traditional labs with defined equipment and measurement methods at the beginning of work. We plan to integrate this educational tool into the traditional educational process applying the blended learning model. This multidisciplinary tool has possibility to be used by a range of students from different scientific and engineering disciplines e.g. ICT specialists, engineers etc. ",data analysis;instruments and methods for the study of radioactive decays;nuclear experiment modeling;nuclear fission;virtual laboratory,data acquisition;data reduction;education;education computing;fission reactions;personnel training;radioactivity;computer-based approach;data acquisition system;engineering disciplines;nuclear experiments;physical experiments;radioactive decay;software and hardwares;virtual laboratories;students,"Kamanin, D.V., Pyatkov, Yu.V., Strekalovsky, A.O., Alexandrov, A.A., Alexandrova, I.A., Kondratyev, N.A., Kuznetsova, E.A., Mkaza, N., Experimental testing of the HI mass reconstruction procedure at LIS setup (2015) International Symposium on Exotic Nuclei ""EXON-2014"", pp. 677-684. , Kalaningrad, Russia, 08-13 September 2014.

An insight is offered into the process of hybrid tutoring of a group of students writing their MA theses on new technologies in language education. The chapter presents the results of a study carried out, in an action-research-mode, alongside the tutoring process. The data come from three different sources: a student satisfaction survey; the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the discourse of the tutorials, both face-to-face and in-cloud; as well as the observation journal kept by the tutor. As the student satisfaction and discourse studies are described in more detail in two other publications (Turula 2014; Turula in press), the present chapter will describe these two briefly, concentrating on the teacher's perspective. It will be argued here that - when employing new technologies in academic education - the teacher needs to keep an open mind in many different ways.

For universities blended classes is cost cutting, and leverages time when physical expansion is out of the question. For faculty / educators - increasing frequency and variety of engagement; transition to fully online teaching. for students - address access / convenience issues (online 24/7 access) while still offering social & instructional interaction opportunities (classroom) As learning and technology evolves one of the more popular teaching formats is a blended learning course where a percentage of the time is face to face and the rest of the time is online. These types of classes are proving quite popular with students who want flexibility but at the same time experience a classroom feel and a personal connection with the teacher and other students. This gives the teacher a two faced problem in designing a class that meets the learning objectives through both formats. It is crucial that the teacher has a very clear vision how the class is going to flow and how the learning objectives will be met in the class room and online to have an effective class. In higher education the teacher must examine five critical areas. 1.Vision - The objectives and Learning outcomes 2.Interaction - The face to face and online interaction. How? What? and when? 3.Content - The ability to create learning modules that expand critical thinking 4.Assesment - Formal and informal assessment – what is important in the grading process 5.evaluation - This should be self peer and student evaluation. Its also very important to get some of reflective evaluation some time after the completion of the class. This paper will examine the process of executing an effective blended learning course. It is one that takes careful preparation, attention to detail, keeping instruction and direction as simple and easy to understand as possible whilst keeping the learning objectives central to the plan. Blended learning can accommodate students of all backgrounds, provide a creative learning environment and give students an extremely positive educational experience. In order to build an effective blended class, it is important to establish what type of class you want to have and how this will be enacted. It is very important that it does not become two courses that run independently of each other. Learning objectives, learning outcomes, content assessment and evaluation have to be in sync with the online and in class interaction. An effective course is well structured, easy to comprehend and allows the student to learn in an independent manner Formal and informal assessments correspond to the student’s ability to grasp the critical thinking aspects of the course. A blended learning format is one that encourages collaboration, discussion and debate. This paper will help educators plan, process and execute a productive course.

The integration of sex- and gender-specific knowledge into medical curricula is limited due to adequate learning material, systematic teacher training and an innovative communication strategy. We aimed at initiating an e-learning and knowledge-sharing platform for Sex and Gender Medicine, the eGender platform (http://egender.charite.de), to ensure that future doctors and health professionals will have adequate knowledge and communication skills on sex and gender differences in order to make informed decisions for their patients. Methods: The web-based eGender knowledge-sharing platform was designed to support the blended learning pedagogical teaching concept and follows the didactic concept of constructivism. Learning materials developed by Sex and Gender Medicine experts of seven universities have been used as the basis for the new learning tools. The content of these tools is patient-centered and provides add-on information on gender-sensitive aspects of diseases. The structural part of eGender was designed and developed using the open source e-learning platform Moodle. The eGender platform comprises an English and a German version of e-learning modules: one focusing on basic knowledge and seven on specific medical disciplines. Each module consists of several courses corresponding to a disease or symptom complex. Self-organized learning has to be managed by using different learning tools, e.g., texts and audiovisual material, tools for online communication and collaborative work. Results: More than 90 users from Europe registered for the eGender Medicine learning modules. The most frequently accessed module was ""Gender Medicine - Basics"" and the users favored discussion forums. These e-learning modules fulfill the quality criteria for higher education and are used within the elective Master Module ""Gender Medicine - Basics"" implemented into the accredited Master of Public Health at Charite - Berlin. Conclusions: The eGender platform is a flexible and user-friendly electronical knowledge-sharing platform providing evidence-based high-quality learning material used by a growing number of registered users.

Qualitative and quantitative data collected for the study were from different sources to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. The quantitative data findings indicated that participating in the PD first module impacted both the teachers learning of effective mathematics teaching, as well as their mathematical content knowledge. Furthermore, they planned to implement what they learned from the PD into their classroom teaching. Qualitative data findings identified three common themes emerging from the data analysis including awareness of high quality resources, students' engagement through the use of games and technology, and tasks to promote students' mathematical thinking.

It is the engineering institutes responsibility to provide the interactive environment for the all-round development of the students. The students who joins for the engineering education would be differed in their attitudes, back ground knowledge, intellectual levels, learning approaches. To improve the students learning capabilities and in turn make them more employable it is necessary to consider the individual properties of students in choosing the type of instruction and teaching methods. To develop the creative and critical thinking skill of students it is necessary to make them to participate in social and working environments. To facilitate the students with different learning approaches, curriculum is to be reviewed and redesigned. In this paper we reviewed four different learning models and we proposed a new integrated learning model which integrates five learning approaches.

The HyFlex model is accepted as an innovative proposal that gives courses Blended Learning new features of flexibility and adaptation with respect to the availability of space and time of the students as well as their way of learning. Our research was mainly oriented towards two issues: The description of the model and case study. These aspects will conclude on an assessment of strengths and weaknesses of HyFlex and strategies for its implementation. Thus, the case study of the UTPL has been positive, but some obstacles have been identified for implementation, mainly related to teacher training. There is little research on HyFlex model but further investigation of these practices is necessary to have sufficient information to assess the relevance of its application in the global context.

To meet the needs of students, one must first define what stipulates a successful K-12 student, the best practices of online classrooms, the warning signs for low-performing students, and how to engage web-based students. Optimizing K-12 Education through Online and Blended Learning addresses the models, support, cases, and delivery of K-12 online education. Seeking to further the conversation about the most effective ways to integrate ICT into the classroom, this publication presents theoretical frameworks to support educators and administrators.

Automatic free-text scoring allows teachers to provide open-ended questions with their correct answers to a computer system, so when students answer the questions, they get immediate feedback (a score, a comment, or both). However, teachers are usually overloaded with many tasks, and they may not have time to create the questions with the correct answers. Therefore, in the 2012/2013 academic year, we asked a group of 124 Pre-Primary and Primary Education students to become the creators of the questions and their correct answers in groups in a free-text scoring system, so the questions use learners’ language, not teachers’ language. From them, 41 students (group of involved students, GIS) fulfilled all the requirements during the course. Our hypothesis was that GIS would be able to increase their academic performance and levels of engagement compared to the rest of the students. The results gathered provide statistic evidence to support that hypothesis. This study pretends to help teachers who want to increase the academic performance and levels of engagement of their students in courses that they may find boring and unrelated to the main topic of their degree, or not directly related with their main academic interests.

Recent high profile MOOCs have shown that e-learning approaches can attract large numbers of students to study subjects such as electronic circuits. However, high dropout rates and concerns about quality mean that it is unlikely that e-learning techniques alone can meet the industrial demand for high calibre engineers. The aim of this work was to understand if the use of a blended learning approach would be a better option and enhance student abilities to analyse electrical and electronic circuits by providing them with additional e-learning resources. It was found that was possible to match the format of e-lectures to lectures to capture well known teaching methods that increase student learning. Student engagement with the e-lectures was very high and they have given good feedback about their experience of using them.

Within this context, collaborating partners used portable hands-on hardware coupled with a model of pedagogy (i.e., blended learning - a combination of lecture and hands-on activities in class; traditional - hands-on activities are completed outside of class time; etc.) to provide instruction in their courses.

Mathematical thinking and learning in engineering education must address the rapidly changing technological innovations and the associated expectations in terms of the quality of learning experiences. Thus, future engineers need to be actively engaged in deep and meaningful mathematical thinking and learning rather than passive information transmission during their engineering mathematics. This paper presents some results of a study carried out to investigate the potential of blended learning and its implication in supporting mathematical thinking among prospective engineers. Mason's et.al. problem solving approach is integrated with BLOSSOMS modules first to produce activity based worksheets and then to conduct blended learning sessions to cultivate mathematical thinking skills among first year engineering students using duet teaching and collaborative learning approaches. The two staged interpretive data analysis is used to explore and interpret the data. The findings showed that blended learning can positively affect students' learning, thus supporting students to think mathematically in the blended learning environment.

Design/methodology/approach: The presented methodology is based on the main principles of flexible and blended learning. The authors considered three main aspects: student’s background, the level of knowledge and the most suitable style of learning. At the beginning of the course, students were randomly divided into reference and test group. The test group students were continuously supported by different tools within an e-learning environment. The learning process for the reference group students was held in a traditional form. Findings: The success of the experiment presented in this paper is demonstrated by comparing the results of the test group who were taught using the new strategy with the reference group who were taught in a common way. The statistical analysis shows that the test group students had better achievements compared to the reference group. Research Limitations/implications: This presented study was carried out with non-IT first-year university students from social sciences, economics and technical faculties. Each year the number of students varied from 150 to 300. Originality/value: Based on developed methodology, the model of individualization of the educational process in an e-environment was created and implemented in the course of Informatics in Tallinn University of Technology.

On that premise, we have collaborated with a group of permanent training advisers to identify the most widely used training typologies. At the same time we have analysed a typology that can bring together the best features of the other two in order to fulfil the necessities of teachers. This article shows a part of that process, presenting the strengths and weaknesses of the training based on blended learning and collecting the valuable contributions of professionals dedicated to these subjects. From the results we can compare the similarities between the major studies conducted up to the present and the people who implement such actions on daily basis.

Despite the significant demand for web-enabled learning, there are obstacles concerning the use of EOTs, which challenge the continued success of blended implementations in higher education. As technology usage accelerates, it is important for TEIs to understand and address the current challenges faced by key stakeholders using EOTs in BTEs, and provide appropriate support. This paper identifies and discusses the challenges stakeholders experience in using EOTs in BTEs. Interviews with 13 blended learning experts from New Zealand, Australia and Canada identified the challenges in using EOTs, and the extent to which these prevent widespread adoption and effective use of EOTs in BTEs. The outcomes of this study will enable them to design relevant approaches to tackle current obstacles in EOT usage, and deliver meaningful support to key stakeholders in BTEs.

This paper presents a case study of the transformative potential of blended learning in the context of the challenge facing higher education across the globe - designing learning instructions for inculcating research oriented teaching in future technical teachers. The need to inculcate research at all levels of University education has been long felt and should be addressed by designing the learning instruction in such a way that research becomes an integral part of the culture of teaching. This paper describes the approach to do so in the case study presented here. Some important leadership, administrative, implementation and scalability issues are addressed. Outlines of action plan using cloud based technologies to support blended learning models are also presented. It was observed that by using the described approach, the usual advantages of traditional model were encashed while the learning experience of students was enhanced using on-line approach.

The purpose of the article is to report on how design-based phases, in the form of micro-, meso- and macro-cycles were applied to improve practice and to generate design principles. Design-based research traditionally is associated with multiple iterations of design, development and revision over a long period of time. This challenges the idea of design-based research being an appropriate methodology for a short-term thesis or dissertation. We argue that graduate students who are limited by time constraints can also conduct educational design-based research as long as the relevant phases are followed, which can produce significant, appropriate and effective design principles. This article suggests that the scope of design-based research should not be limited to long-term projects only, which restricts the value of implementing this methodology to improve practice.

An examination of recent changes in higher education points to apparent resemblances of significant impact from blended learning. As an alternative approach of a traditionally defined educational delivery process with the help of technology, blended learning finds its influence in a much wider spectrum in higher education. This paper attempts to re-define blended learning as a multifaceted expectation of higher education with four postulated features. A culture-based perspective predicts slower acceptance of blended learning in Chinese higher education system than in the U.S. higher education system. The paper argues that internationalization in higher education would greatly facilitate the acceptance of blended learning, but with a slow pace for a small number of early participating institutions.

Unfortunately, this definition not only hides the complexity and transformative possibilities of blended learning, it can also leave the academic teaching developer without the detail and certainty they need to develop learning designs that address their institution’s blended delivery expectations and meet their students’ learning needs. Our approach to supporting academic change to blended learning addresses these uncertainties and places emphasis on the pedagogic strategies that guide student learning activity and drive the design of integrated learning experiences across learning environments. We present two models - a four phase blended learning model and a two-layer design model, and demonstrate how the properties of each combine to afford a blended learning design approach.

Each course module provided 80 h of blended learning (a mixture of online and face-to-face training). The effectiveness of high-level blended learning for training MPEs up to EQF level 8 was tested on optimisation in mammography and general radiology. The training methods were evaluated using a questionnaire (89% response rate) and reviewing participants’ proposed optimisation studies. The online training was the most highly rated part of the module. The participants produced a wide range of feasible and interesting optimisation proposals. All questionnaire responders intend to undertake their study. Overall, the proposals showed a good understanding of the process of optimisation, but some showed weaknesses in applying the results clinically. The blended learning approach showed potential for training MPEs to undertake successful optimisation projects.

Two sets of questionnaires were developed to measure the degree of student's self-efficacy, and to facilitate self evaluation. Participants were surveyed twice during the course, using the metrics mentioned above, and their emotional and cognitive changes were evaluated. The number of valid participants was 54. Scores of metrics between the two surveys were compared. Though most scores for self-efficacy and self assessment decreased, this suggests that participants recognised their actual learning situation well. To illustrate participant's emotional and cognitive changes, causal analysis was introduced. The relationships between scores for self-efficacy and self evaluation in the two surveys were analysed and compared. Also, the impact of improvements in note-taking skills on changes in self-efficacy and self-evaluation were examined using causal analyses. These results show that note-taking activities significantly stimulated the level of selfefficacy and self-assessment when the lecturer's instructions were able to improve note-taking skills factor scores during the course.

In 2015, a Norwegian teacher education received internal funding to develop a MOOC intended for blended learning, which we call bMOOC. The bMOOC consisted of four different modules, and the course content was created internally by highly competent teacher trainers. One goal with the bMOOC was to familiarize teacher students and teacher educators with the concept of blended learning. Another goal was to support students’ academic writing processes across courses and possibly take some of the workload connected to instruction and feedback off the teacher trainers. The article analyzes the outcome of the implementation of the bMOOC, which shows low user adoption rate and low course completion. The study questions whether teacher educators see the pedagogical value in MOOCs and whether teacher students have enough digital competence to make use of online learning objects in formal learning.

Due to the continuously rising number of students and the resulting variety of student's technical backgrounds, it is no longer possible to offer laboratory sessions to all registered students. As a result, we established a framework that allows the students to experiment by using the theoretical principles from the lecture without having to participate in the laboratory courses. That means, the framework has to cover a whole range of different aspects involving the planning and engineering of a plant by means of Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams, the physical simulation and the eventual implementation of the automation application. Our framework concept, while not originally part of the Blended Learning project, represents a teaching program that well aligns with the Blended Learning approach supported by RWTH Aachen University.

To conduct a quantitative comparison of the contents of all notes for effective instruction from lecturer to students to occur, the contents were mathematically compared and evaluated using two ways of summarizing the frequency of term co-occurrences. In order to evaluate visually the differences between the contents of notes taken, an adjacency matrix and Levenshtein distance metrics were employed to represent noun co-occurrence in the notes. In comparing notes between the lecturer and students, insufficient distance and additional distance are defined and measured for all participants during the course. In the results, students recorded additional nouns to replace the nouns given by the lecturer, and introduced new nouns of their own as substitutes as well. There are significant correlation relationships between the above mentioned distances and the ratios, such as between the word ratio and coverage, which have been defined in previous studies. Also, summarizing ways of co-occurrence frequency did not affect any of the relationships. Finally, possible applications for visualizing learning activities of the lecturer and students are discussed.

To train journalism students to think critically cannot be achieved in one day. It may take years to transform the mindset of journalism students from a rigid to an open-minded disposition. Thus, education is the starting point to introduce the concept of critical thinking into journalism students. Journalism students are expected to apply knowledge learned from university into everyday life practices in the future. In order to motivate students to train themselves and to practice the learned skills in their everyday life, this study designed a gamified platform to assist the teaching and to promote selftraining for students after the class. A gamified platform and a blended leaning curriculum were designed for the research purpose. Some gaming elements including goals, challenges and quests, progress, feedback, competition and cooperation, actual grading, visible status, access/ unlocking content, freedom of choice, freedom to fail, storytelling, new identities and roles were employed in this gamified platform. During an 18-week experimental instruction period with 32 journalism students, the instructional design included: (a) introduction to critical thinking, (b) introduction to media literacy, (c) introduction to Toulmin's argument model, (d) critical thinking skills, (e) introduction to argument fallacies, (f) media argument fallacies, (g) critical thinking strategies. The Critical Thinking Test Level II(CTT-II) and a pretest-posttest control group design were employed in this study. Through repeated measure analysis of variance, it was found that the participants significantly improved their critical thinking skills through the gamified platform with the experimental instruction in a blended learning environment. The findings suggest that the blended learning model developed in this study facilitates ""meaningful gamification"" experiences and contribute to the development of critical-thinking training for journalism education.

Blended learning (BL), combining face-toface teaching with computer-based technologies, is also an accessible and flexible education method for teaching global health and related topics. When organised as inter-institutional collaboration, BL also has potential for sharing teaching resources. However, there is insufficient data on the costs of BL in higher education. Objective: Our goal was to evaluate the total provider costs of BL in teaching health research methods in a three-university collaboration. Design: A retrospective evaluation was performed on a BL course on randomised controlled trials, which was led by Stellenbosch University (SU) in South Africa and joined by Swedish and Ugandan universities. For all three universities, the costs of the BL course were evaluated using activity-based costing with an ingredients approach. For SU, the costs of the same course delivered with a classroom learning (CL) approach were also estimated. The learning outcomes of both approaches were explored using course grades as an intermediate outcome measure. Results: In this contextually bound pilot evaluation, BL had substantially higher costs than the traditional CL approach in South Africa, even when average per-site or per-student costs were considered. Staff costs were the major cost driver in both approaches, but total staff costs were three times higher for the BL course at SU. This implies that inter-institutional BL can be more time consuming, for example, due to use of new technologies. Explorative findings indicated that there was little difference in students' learning outcomes. Conclusions: The total provider costs of the inter-institutional BL course were higher than the CL course at SU. Long-term economic evaluations of BL with societal perspective are warranted before conclusions on full costs and consequences of BL in teaching global health topics can be made.

As part of the project we offer a joint course during the spring semester which was followed by 30 students in 2015. It contains both course and project activities. In this paper we describe our experiences from the project work, from the initial formulation of the project problems by the companies, over the organisation of the seminars and virtual collaboration phase to the final exams. The whole course was organised as follows: First there was a virtual kick-off meeting for all students and teachers. This was followed by a phase where students studied different modules online. Each student chooses an individual combination of modules that fits his/her background while also supporting the later project work. After the online modules, the students and teachers all meet physically for a week in Istanbul to finalize the modules and begin working on the real life projects provided by the enterprises. Then there was a period of virtual collaboration in the groups followed by the final seminar in Riga where everyone (students, teachers, and company representatives) met to finalize the projects, prepare for presentations/exams, and conduct examinations. Overall, the project was successful and received positive evaluations from the students, particularly regarding the international and interdisciplinary dimensions. On the other hand, we also learned how important it is to facilitate the collaboration, group work, and project planning during the first physical seminar. We found that it is both challenging and important to be very explicit about what exactly is expected from the students, as both students and supervisors have differing understandings of what a project is. Discussing the learning objectives with the students to obtain a common understanding can be a useful tool.

With a standard web browser as the only user requirement on the client-side, the system becomes suitable for blended learning approaches for university physics students. VISPA was used in two consecutive years each by approx. 100 third year physics students at the RWTH Aachen University for their homework assignments. For example, in one exercise students gained a deeper understanding of Einsteins mass-energy relation by analyzing experimental data of electron-positron pairs revealing J/Ψ and Z particles. Because the students were free to choose their working hours, only few users accessed the platform simultaneously. The positive feedback from students and the stability of the platform lead to further development of the concept. This year, students accessed the platform in parallel while they analyzed the data recorded by demonstrated experiments live in the lecture hall. The platform is based on experience in the development of professional analysis tools. It combines core technologies from previous projects: an object-oriented C++ library, a modular data-driven analysis flow, and visual analysis steering. We present the platform and discuss its benefits in the context of teaching based on surveys that are conducted each semester.

Learning language online has been a new experience to preparatory year students at the University of Dammam. They have been given access to Oxford University Press Online e-learning system that has a complete language course called (QSkills) online where students can fully study online or supplement that with their face to face instructions. However, there have been some issues in this implementation and some pedagogical and technical challenges. This paper highlights these issues and challenges and attempts to propose some practical solutions. The results showed some technical and pedagogical issues and challenges that should be addressed properly by the environment; yet, there was some positive feedback that should be capitalized on to facilitate more the learning process.

The NF model suggests that teams reach maximum group creativity when participants experience high levels of flow and social presence. Moreover, the model predicts that emergence of NF is associated with specific group structural dynamics. The research protocol consisted in a longitudinal mixed-method design, which integrated: (i) the analysis of experiential features of collaborative experience (flow, social presence); (ii) the analysis of communicative interaction; (iii) the structural features of collaboration dynamics (social network indexes). Preliminary findings suggest the feasibility and potential usefulness of integrating quali-quantitative methods for the investigation of NF in creative collaboration settings.

Institutions that have launched successful MOOC initiatives have much to learn from each other, just as universities interested in evaluating the viability of a MOOC initiative at their institution may find lessons from others valuable for their decision-making process. This chapter explores the history and implications of MOOCs from the perspective of an institution that maintains active partnerships with multiple MOOC providers, producing numerous MOOCs every year. We outline a number of challenges, opportunities, and issues facing the adoption of MOOCs at an institution of higher education and provide recommendations for consideration. The chapter specifically addresses how MOOCs have transformed and can continue to transform the landscape of higher education, and how institutions of higher education can respond with agility to a rapidly changing landscape of tools and approaches. Based on the institutional experiences of the Technische Universitat Munchen (TUM) in developing and supporting a MOOC initiative, supported where relevant by current scholarship, we provide commentary and analysis on current public perception of MOOCs as well as a hypothesis, based on the Gartner Hype Cycle, about the future trajectory of MOOCs.

Various learning methodologies have appeared from industrial age to the information age and knowledge based society, and they have changed according to the trend of the times. As one of these learning methodologies, flipped learning appeared based on blended learning. It reverses the traditional learning methodology. It has the paradigm of studying new learning materials online at home and performing various activities such as review, exercise, discussion, debates and assessments, etc. offline in the classroom. English subjects are regarded as suitable for flipped learning because reading and listening can be designed to be performed online as activities of information input, and writing and speaking can be designed to be performed offline as activities of information output. Among the various activities performed in the offline space which are procured by the flipped learning methodology, debates are one of the most effective activities. Debates promote mutual understanding between instructors and learners by their joint participation in debates, facilitate the study of what they have learned and propose solutions in discourses. The methods for activating debates suggested in this article are case briefing and the Socratic method. Applying them in English subjects, case briefing takes the central place in understanding English discourses, and the Socratic method can be utilized for solving problems based on the understanding of discourses.

Recently, training for electrical tests has been supported by virtual reality systems; nonetheless, these training systems are not yet adaptive. We propose a b-learning model to support adaptive and distance training. The adaptation is based on a representation of the knowledge and affect of the trainee. One of the main components is an animated pedagogical agent who guides trainees and provides instruction. The agent deploys different facial expressions conveying emotion and empathy to trainees. We incorporated these constructs into the learning model aiming to achieve credibility, social interaction, and user engagement, and thus improve learning. To develop the agent, we included some of the basic characteristics of electricians: work uniform and safety gear, such as helmets, gloves, and glasses, among other features. We believe that by representing the tutor as an electrician, the training environment will be better accepted by operators. The focus of this paper is a study that we conducted to gather knowledge about the expressivity and appearance of the animated agent. The participants evaluated the facial expressions of the agent and stated their point of view regarding the incorporation of the animated agent into the training system. The gathered knowledge is being used to enhance the animated agent before completing its integration to the training environment",affective student model;blended learning;electrical tests;empathetic agents;virtual reality,,"Arendarski, B., Termath, W., Mecking, P., Maintenance of complex machines in electric power systems using virtual reality techniques (2008) Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Electrical Insulation ISEI 2008, pp. 483-487; Barata, P.N.A., Ribeiro Filho, M., Alves Nunes, M.V., Virtual reality applied to the study of the integration of transformers in substations of power systems (2015) International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 52 (3), pp. 203-218; Barragan, R., Garcia, R., Buzon, O., Rebollo, M.A., Vega, L., E-portfolio in blended-learning processes: Assessment innovations in the European credits transfer system (2009) RED Revista de Educacion a Distancia, 8 (1), pp. 1-16; Breese, J.S., Ball, G., Modeling emotional state and personality for conversational agents (Microsoft Research Technical Report MSR-TR-98-41) (1998), Palo Alto, CA: AAAI Press; Burdea, G.C., Coiffet, P., (2003) Virtual reality technology, , New Brunswick, NJ: Wiley-IEEE Press; Cardoso, A., Lamounier, E., Lima, G., Oliveira, L., Mattioli, L., Junior, G., Silva, A., Newton, J., VRCEMIG: A virtual reality system for real time control of electric substations (2013) IEEE Virtual Reality Conference, pp. 165-166; (2007) Procedimiento de pruebas de campo para equipo primario de subestaciones de distribucion [Field tests procedure for primary distribution substations equipment] (CFE Handbook SOM-3531), , Mexico: Comision Federal de Electricidad; Conati, C., Mclaren, H., Empirically building and evaluating a probabilistic model of user affect (2009) User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 19, pp. 267-303; Dev, P., Heinrichs, W.L., Learning medicine through collaboration and action: Collaborative, experiential, networked learning environments (2008) Virtual Reality, 12 (4), pp. 215-234; Ekman, P., Friesen, W., (1978) Facial action coding system: A T echnique for the measurement of facial movement, , Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press; Fuchs, P., Moreau, G., Guitton, P., (2011) Virtual reality: Concepts and technologies, , London, UK: CRC Press; Garrison, D.R., Vaughan, N.D., (2008) Blended learning in higher education: Framework, principles, and guidelines, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Gulz, A., Ahlner, F., Haake, M., (2007) Visual femininity and masculinity in synthetic characters and patterns of affect In Proceedings of International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction ACCI, pp. 654-665. , Heidelberg, Germany: Springer; Haake, M., Gulz, A., A Look at the roles of look & roles in embodied pedagogical agents-A User preference perspective (2009) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 19 (1), pp. 39-71; Harrington, M.C.R., Empirical evidence of priming, transfer, reinforcement, and learning in the real and virtual trillium trails (2011) IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 4 (2), pp. 175-186; Heinze, A., Procter, C., Reflections on the use of blended learning (2004) Education in a Changing Environment Conference 2004, , http://www.ece.salford.ac.uk/proceedings/papers/ah_04.rtf, Salford, UK: Education Development Unit, University of Salford; Hernandez, Y., Sucar, L.E., Arroyo-Figueroa, G., Affective modeling for an intelligent educational environment (2013) Intelligent and Adaptive Educational-Learning Systems: Achievements and Trends, pp. 3-24. , A.

With this program, TU Delft affords its students an opportunity to dedicate the first semester of their 3rd BSc year to a set of courses chosen among the numerous options offered by this, or another, university. Students are not only allowed but encouraged to explore topics and study fields outside their main BSc track. The Spaceflight minor is designed as a multidisciplinary, thematic program, in which the students gain insight in the demand for space applications, mission analysis, system requirements and sizing. This multidisciplinary setup is facilitated by the recently established TU Delft Space Institute (DSI), of which all the faculties involved in the minor are members. The minor and the DSI provide a unique opportunity to strengthen space education and research across TU Delft. The minor covers two quarters over twenty weeks and includes six courses. Offered in the first quarter are: Introduction to Spaceflight (for students without Aerospace Engineering background) or Electronic Circuits (for the other students); Space Exploration, with basics and examples of planetary and astronomical exploration and an introduction to space law; Earth Observation, covering basics of remote sensing of the Earth. The second quarter includes: Spacecraft Technology, providing an overview of the technology of spacecraft subsystems with emphasis on small satellites; Satellite Tracking Communication, on telecommunications, ground station operations and telemetry analysis from a theoretical and practical point of view; Spaceflight Assignment, the final project in which students produce real, small-scale space deliverables, and reflect on the process and results of development and analysis in the complex space engineering and scientific environment. In total, 15 lecturers from three TU Delft faculties and one from Leiden University contributed to the minor. Many of the courses employ innovative education techniques, such as flipped classrooms and videos produced by the lecturers. Some courses are simultaneously offered to campus students and external participants in a full online format. The first edition of the minor, delivered from September 2015 to January 2016 to 50 students from various TU Delft faculties, can be considered a success with excellent feedback from participants. The paper elaborates on the minor design and learning objectives, showing how multidisciplinary, innovative education can be effectively implemented for students with different academic backgrounds.

As a spontaneous phenomenon, the concept concerns a form of plurilingual communication in which each speaker uses his/her own language and understands that of the other(s). The general aim of this chapter is to explain the specific features of Intercomprehension didactics between Romance languages, demonstrating that characteristics like the simultaneous learning of several languages, the exploitation of similarities within a linguistic family along a dialect continuum, the development of partial and transversal competences represent an approach particularly useful for learners' needs and agree with the demands of a Language Centre. The paper outlines, therefore, the most important features of the devices and didactic materials created for intercomprehension, in particular those whose efficiency as Best Practices was widely recognized by the project REDINTER - European Network for Intercomprehension. Moreover, the chapter reports on the recent completion of one of these projects, EuRom5, and shows its characteristics and the results of its implementation during a blended learning series of activities carried out through the online Moodle platform. Bearing the results of that course in mind, we suggest an example for the integration of a training program based on the principles of IC in a specific institutional context: the Language Centre of the University of Roma Tre (CLA) which is engaged in the development of innovative techniques in the field of Language Teaching.

For this reason, a new approach has been considered in Aerospace Engineering at Technical University of Valencia (UPV) which, in addition to master classes, includes assignments specially designed to achieve mathematical competencies in the first year. These assignments reinforce the learning process of students and increase their competencies before each assessment test. On the other hand PoliformaT, an educational platform developed by UPV, and based on the Sakai project, has facilitated to develop a flipped teaching methodology in the one hour lab sessions in the first year of Aerospace Engineering. Thus a blended learning methodology, a combination of computer technologies and face-to-face classes, has provided very good learning outcomes results for Spanish standards. We present some results concerning our first year Mathematics course in Aerospace Engineering and the opinion of the students about this blended learning methodology.

Encouraging active learning and entrepreneurship are in the skeleton of competencies that the new engineer must achieve for several reasons. Ideas and solutions to new challenges quite often require creative and innovative engineers that have to catch up with a resilient society where environment and conditions are continuously changing. This contrasts with the traditional input-oriented approach to higher education focusing on the transmission of defined curriculum content. Thus there is need to get even further of a learning outcomes orientation, focusing on what the student is expected to know, understand and be able to do. The shift towards a learning outcomes approach is really a major cultural transformation that is taking time to become fully implemented. In order to tackle this issue from the first stages of a just newcomer university student, the authors propose an active methodology in Mathematics theoretical classes for Aerospace Engineering students that provides activities to be developed by them before each theoretical and problem solving exam comes as part of their apprenticeship. In this way the students are faced in front of activities designed to develop their competencies achievement by promoting their deep understanding of the subject and having to confront their engineering skills while learning a basic subject such as Mathematics. Since these activities are not developed in a controlled environment, students must perform an individual test at the time of delivery to check their authorship and understanding of the processes developed at their activities.

We present the outcomes of a quantitative study carried out during the academic year 2010/2011 at the Pontifical University of Salamanca (Spain). In this research, we have decided to select this subject because it has commonly been taught in a traditional way. This study explores the validity and benefits of an innovative technological model implemented in a blended learning group. To investigate this issue, we suggest the following hypotheses: The English phonetic and phonology learning level and the satisfaction of our students will be higher with the implementation of this technological innovative model. The VLE implemented will help them to develop their ability to perceive and produce English more accurately, and it will supply them with a natural environment for pronunciation practice. The obtained results confirm these hypotheses and show the possibilities of the model implemented to improve the teaching-learning process.

E-Business Application in higher education has already become an indispensable tool in both university staff and students' daily life. A number of technological, educational and business models of e-Business application in higher education have been developed. However, the educational models of e-Business application in higher education mostly focus on blended learning, thereby they lack the blended educational process that comprises blended teaching, peer-learning and learning. These one-sided educational models do not contribute to the qualitative blended educational process for the improvement of students' learning achievements. Aim of the present paper is to work out the educational model of e-Business application in higher education underpinning analysis of quality of the institutionalized blended educational process for the improvement of students' learning achievements. The meaning of the key concepts e-Business application and blended learning is studied. Moreover, the logical chain of analysis is shown: e-Business → blended learning → a model of the blended educational process → empirical study within a multicultural environment. The results of the present research show that students' learning achievements after having been implemented the blended educational process have been enhanced. Directions of further research are proposed.

We reviewed grades given by self and peers on video presentations, as well as grades given by instructors and markers in similar in-class presentations, then asked students questions on the effectiveness (n-115). The preliminary findings indicate that students gained confidence from using the video platform, which correlated with improved public speaking skills. We also found, in the first of three tracked assignments, a correlation between the grades given by peers (on video) and the grades given by instructors (in-class) indicating the students' ability to assess themselves and their peers in a manner similar to the instructors'.

Blended or online learning is nowadays current practice also in language teaching, with new technical solutions constantly being taken into use. At Satakunta University of Applied Sciences (SAMK) in Finland, HILL, an online lecture system and e-learning environment is used in teaching. The aim of HILL is to provide adult students with an e-learning environment that facilitates combining of studies, work and family life. Students can follow lectures via HILL from anywhere and interact with the lecturer or participants. Sessions can also be recorded. The HILL concept was developed in cooperation between SAMK, IBM, Cisco and AKG. It has been used in teaching since 2010. For example, in November 2014 there were about 300 HILL sessions and 3000 users, and the number is increasing rapidly. Languages have been taught in SAMK via HILL since 2012. This is a case study concentrating on the possibilities and challenges that blended learning via HILL has brought into language learning.

As a result a variety of projects were launched to develop new teaching and learning arrangements while optimizing existing approaches. In this paper we present a Blended Learning concept for a Software Engineering course. The course design and the different components used are explained in detail. This is done in order to support further improvements in terms of activation and motivation as well as competency promotion of learners.

The features of this method lie in four aspects. Firstly, we use weighted online learning to train a segmentation model to achieve the blended learning framework. Secondly, we perform co-segmentation based on unsupervised clustering to analyze the shape set, and initialize this segmentation model. Thirdly, based on this segmentation model, users can segment new shapes by using supervised progressive learning method. And this segmentation model can also be incrementally updated by weighted online learning during the progressive segmentation. Finally, the segmentation of shapes in the initial set can be corrected based on the updated segmentation model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Learners studying various subjects within the same department are commonly pooled into one language class. Besides, there is a great disparity among the students' language levels. How can learners' needs be met in such a context? A case study of the English course designed for students in the History, Arts and Archeology section in their second year of master's degree at Universite de Lorraine highlights the crucial role of autonomising learners. Indeed, the implementation of a blended learning course including face to face sessions and self-directed work at the language centre has been instrumental in overcoming the obstacles linked to the diverging needs of the learners. This case study focuses on the pre-requisites to creating such a learning system as well as on its concrete implementation and then offers an assessment of the system described",autonomisation;blended learning;pedagogical role;self-assessment,,"Chateau, A., Zumbihl, H., Le carnet de bord, un outil permettant le cheminement vers l'autonomisation dans un dispositif d'apprentissage de l'anglais en ligne?

Design strategies for the reproduction of professionals' authentic contexts are suggested with guidelines for the actual development of a blended learning course. According to the development research methodology, along with a prototype e-learning course, six design strategies were developed as follows: (1) select and identify authentic tasks that practitioners or experts can solve; (2) analyze the context of solving the authentic task; (3) model experts' cognitive and behavioral processes of solving the authentic task; (4) develop assessment tools for the authentic task; (5) apply instructional strategies to provide authentic contexts by using technologies; and (6) develop instructional resources and environments. Two task analysis methods, activity theory and PARI (Precursor-Action- Results-Interpretation), were employed to identify authentic troubleshooting problems of energy auditing. Constructivist learning models and strategies were implemented; they had been adopted from situated learning, anchored instruction, cognitive apprenticeship, and goal-based scenarios. The research implications and limitations are discussed for generalization in future studies.

This demands a new way of looking at teaching and learning, and raises many questions (e.g. how to become an online teacher). Therefore, many institutions and professionals try to meet such demands by offering professional development initiatives, aiming to provide teachers with new knowledge, skills, and attitudes towards teaching in an online setting. The technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) framework provides meaningful insights into teachers' necessary knowledge requirements for technology integration. Using the TPACK framework, this paper presents an overview and first analysis of the emphases placed by different teacher professional development approaches. This study will investigate the teacher professional development approaches of research articles by conducting a content analysis of each article, and by comparing the teacher professional development approaches. The analysis consists of sorting the textual data into different categories, and identifying different patterns and themes, which will be held against the TPACK framework. This is done for each individual study (within-case analysis) and between the studies (cross-case analysis). Furthermore, the initial results of this study will be discussed and the first recommendations for future research and practice will be formulated. Moreover, the results can be beneficial for practitioners involved in teacher professional development with regard to online and blended learning, to guide the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of a professional development approach. Therefore, the findings of this article can be of use to teachers, institutions, and professionals who wish to gain more insight into the current trends of existing professional development approaches, and provide them with a more thorough understanding of the initiatives that support teachers to become effective in online and blended learning. Further research could investigate if there is a link between the addressed TPACK elements in a teacher professional development approach and the retained results",online and blended learning;online teaching;teacher professional development;technology integration;tpack,data mining;e-learning;education;professional aspects;blended learning;online teaching;teacher professional development;technology integration;tpack;teaching,"Ching, C.C., Hursh, A.W., Peer modeling and innovation adoption among teachers in online professional development (2014) Computers & Education, pp. 72-82; Comas-Quinn, A., Learning to teach online or learning to become and online teacher: an exploration of teachers' experiences in a blended learning course (2011) ReCALL, 23 (3), pp. 218-232; Cowan, P., The 4I model for scaffolding the professional development of experienced teachers in the use of virtual learning environments for classroom teaching (2013) Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education, 13 (1), pp. 82-98; Doering, A., Veletsianos, G., Scharber, C., Using the technological, pedagogical and content knowledge framework to design online learning environments and professional development (2009) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 41 (3), pp. 319-346; Ernest, P., Guitert Catasus, M., Hampel, R., Online teacher development: Collaborating in a virtual learning environment (2013) Computer Assisted Language Learning, 26 (4), pp. 311-333; Koehler, M.J., Mishra, P., What is technological pedagogical content knowledge?

International research projects, such as OIKODOMOS and OIKONET look for tools that will enable wide international collaboration and enhancement of education with a focus on support of the blended-learning pedagogical model: the virtual campus. To apply this virtual campus to architectural education at several universities, three environments were developed: workspaces, case repository and OIKOpedia. This effort is focused on the problem of innovative housing learning and on different aspects of contemporary global dwelling: participation, sustainability and energy efficiency, informal architecture, digital fabrication, integrated and parametric design approach - results of student workshops bringing new ideas.

Yip-Hoi DM;Welch JG,6603522623;56763447000,Enhancing a Blended Learning Approach to CAD Instruction Using Lean Manufacturing Principles,2015,"ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",122nd ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition: Making Value for Society,122nd ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition: Making Value for Society,,,,,1.0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941998175&partnerID=40&md5=dd573d65d8d6dba617924a787a23adb3,"Western Washington University, Department of Engineering Technology, United States","Yip-Hoi, D.M., Western Washington University, Department of Engineering Technology, United States; Welch, J.G., Western Washington University, Department of Engineering Technology, United States","The Department of Engineering and Design at Western Washington University has implemented a blended learning methodology in its introductory Computer-Aided Design course. This methodology improves learning using a combination of techniques which improve the efficiency of delivery of course content while maximizing value-added student activities where interactions with the instructor and TAs are prized. These techniques include a ""flipped classroom"" model, on-line video instructional materials, efficient content modularization and customizability, automated feedback, integrated assessment mechanisms and team-based in-class activities. A high proportion of class time is structured to support creative project work where students appropriate CAD skills by applying them to creative problem solving. It is the opinion of the authors that this blended learning methodology has the potential to provide a just-in-time delivery of instruction which can be customized to meet an individual student's need. While traditional assessment techniques are designed to measure student course outcomes, they do little to measure the efficiency of instruction. Since there is an undeniable connection between the delivery mechanism and how well a student learns, it can be postulated that the ability to measure the performance of this mechanism and to adjust this in a systematic way, needs to be an integral part of any strategy for improving student learning. In this paper we present a perspective that looks to the body of work in Lean Manufacturing to provide a framework for better understanding the performance of the blended learning mechanism we have adopted. The Toyota Production System (TPS) is one view of Lean Manufacturing. Amongst other concepts, it identifies Muda (unnecessary work), Muri (overburden) and Mura (unevenness) as the three contributors to waste in manufacturing. The goal of Lean Manufacturing is to control and ultimately eliminate these three sources of waste. This view of manufacturing can be applied to an instructional environment. For example, Muda can manifest itself in repetitive instruction needed to keep students with different learning abilities in step. Muri can result from increasing class sizes where the instructor and TA are spread thin in their coverage of student needs. And, Mura can be created by the traditional approach to instruction where it is available only at scheduled times and in a specific location. Mitigating these inefficiencies can be viewed as developing a Lean Education philosophy in the same way that lean principles have been applied to other disciplines outside of manufacturing such as in the health care, construction, distribution and service industries. This paper will review the mechanisms of a blended learning approach developed for this introductory CAD course. Each activity performed and technique used by the instructor, TAs and students will be described and categorized in terms of lean principles such as the three discussed in the previous paragraph. This will show that new approaches to education such as blended learning have the potential to be organized and managed using a Lean Education framework that is analogous to the one for manufacturing. Further, the authors will present several ideas on how using this perspective on instruction can be used to benefit when developing and running a course adapted to the blended learning philosophy.

The strategies were developed during several years, using the main principles of flexible and blended learning. The methodology has been based on the results of experiments with students from social sciences, economics and technical faculties. Numerous tests were carried out to find out the level of prior knowledge and the preferred learning styles of each student. According to the results, students were divided into separate groups within an e-learning environment. The authors considered three main aspects: student's background, the level of knowledge and the most suitable style of learning. The success of the experiment presented in this paper is demonstrated by comparing the academic results of the test group who was taught using the new strategy with the reference group, taught in a common way",e-learning;felder-silverman model;flexible learning,e-learning;education;students;teaching;blended learning;e-learning environment;flexible learning;informatics;learning style;prior knowledge;reference group;university students;computer aided instruction,"Broadbent, B., (2002) ABCs of E-Learning: Reaping the Benefits and Avoiding the Pitfalls, , 1st ed.

This article outlines how an outcome-based learning system has been implemented in an Engineering Design course, and the challenges associated with the process - not only for the instructor, but also for the students. It is known that there are pros and cons in regard with the adoption of learning outcomes. By implementing the learning outcomes, the students have a clear statement of what they need to achieve, but some authors argue that it does not engage the learner [1]. In an effort to address this issue, the article explains how several teaching and learning approaches were implemented in the Engineering Design course, including the flipped teaching. The effect of outcomes-based course development on course content, sequence, delivery and assessment are reviewed.

Coming from an industrial background a driving force behind all my developments has been efficiency; helping students to develop their knowledge and understanding, their skills and attributes as quickly and effectively as possible, but at the same time acknowledging that my time is precious. In my early teaching I was heavily influenced by Honey and Mumford, recognising that we are all different and prefer to learn in different styles. As such I adapted my teaching styles to suite the students' preferred learning style. Later I became one of the pioneers of e-learning, helping to develop a virtual learning environment to support the students' learning outside the classroom through the internet. This naturally extended to the use of e-assessment and computer aided marking. More recently I have been advocating the use of Electronic Voting Systems to encourage greater engagement by students in the classroom through both summative and formative assessment. Whilst I have been a proponent of ""Blended Learning"" since before the phrase became popular, many students often see the variety of learning opportunities as ""alternatives"", opting out of anything they do not particularly like. Whilst this may lead to an efficient learning process in the students mind, it can also lead to an ineffective learning experience with students underachieving. Like it or not, assessment drives learning (Gibbs & Simpson, 2004), however by using a variety of appropriate assessment methods students are encouraged to actively engage in all the learning opportunities we offer them. If you want to change student learning then change the methods of assessment (Brown, Bull & Pendlebury, 1997). The key to this is selecting assessment methods that will not bury the academic in unassailable mountains of marking. This paper charts the development of my initiatives in teaching, learning and assessment, with tips and warnings coming from my experience for anyone wishing to adopt any of my methods",blended learning;computer aided assessment;electronic voting systems;learning styles;peer assessment;virtual learning environment,e-learning;education;online systems;students;teaching;voting machines;blended learning;computer-aided assessment;electronic voting systems;learning style;peer assessment;virtual learning environments;computer aided instruction,"Abdulwahed, M., Nagy, Z., Crawford, A., Development & implementation of teaching aids to enhance the understanding of control systems (2012), Enhancing Engineering Higher Education: Outputs of the National HE STEM Programme; Brown, G., Bull, J., Pendlebury, M., Assessing Student Learning in Higher Education (1997), Routledge, Oxford, UK; Gibbs, G., Simpson, C., Conditions under which Assessment Supports Students' Learning (2004) Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, (1); Honey, P., Mumford, A., The manual of learning styles (1982), Peter Honey, Maidenhead; Russell, M., Evaluating the Weekly Assessed Tutorials Sheet approach to assessment: Background, pedagogy and impact (2005) Journal for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching, 2 (1); Russell, M., Evaluating the Weekly Assessed Tutorials Sheet approach to assessment: The students' experience (2006) Journal for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching, 3 (1); Russell, M., Using an electronic voting system to enhance learning and teaching (2008) Engineering Education, 3 (2); Xiao, S., Germany, D., Russell, M., Re-engineering assessment for engineering education (2012) Enhancing Engineering Higher Education: Outputs of the National HE STEM Programme","Proc Eur Conf e-Learn, ECEL",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977117700,1,1.0,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,university of hertfordshire,university of hertfordshire,adopt;alternatives;anyone;anything;appropriate;appropriate assessment;assessment;assessment brown;assessment drive;assessment method;attributes;background;brown;bull;bull pendlebury;bury;change;change student;charts;classroom;computer;development;developments;different style;drive learning;drives;eassessment;efficiency;efficient;electronic voting;encourage;engage;engagement;environment;experience;force;formative assessment;gibbs;honey;industrial background;ineffective learning;initiatives;internet;key;knowledge;lead;learn;many student;method student;methods;mind;mountains;mumford;offer;opportunities;paper;paper chart;pendlebury;phrase;pioneers;prefer;process;proponent;provide;reflection;simpson;skills;student;student mind;student today;students;style;styles;suite;summative;support;systems;time;tips;today;unassailable mountain;use;variety;virtual learning;voting;voting system;want;warnings;whilst;year;year experience;years,assessment,269

It draws on the Entrepreneurship through Serious Games (eSG) EU project, co-funded by EACEA in the framework of the lifelong learning programme (LLP) in 2011. The collaborative project was carried out in three EU countries (Italy, Spain and the Netherlands), where three different courses in Entrepreneurship for higher education students were designed, delivered and evaluated. This paper focuses on the Italian experience and devotes specific attention to the two courses (one for each of the two years of the project) carried out at the University of Genoa (UNIGE), involving students of non-business faculties (engineering). The two courses were based on a blended-learning model, used gamification techniques and adopted innovative ICT tools, such as Serious Games (SGs). In the paper, the learning/teaching methodology adopted in the Italian courses is described and the overall potential of the blended strategy is highlighted. Actually, following Pankin et al. (2012) the two courses can correctly be classified as blended, as they adopted a learning/teaching strategy based on: different learning or instructional methods (lecture, discussion, guided practice, reading, games, case study, simulation), different delivery methods (live classroom or computer mediated), different scheduling (synchronous or asynchronous) and different levels of guidance (individual, instructor or expert led, or group/social learning) (Pankin, Roberts, and July, 2012). As a matter of fact, one of the key elements of the two UNIGE courses was the integration of gaming sessions with both theoretical lectures and talks with entrepreneurs and experts in the field; in addition some parts of the courses required attendance of classroom lectures while other parts only required online presence and related activities. Different levels of guidance were also experienced by participants during the courses: they were invited to work both individually and in groups and the learning process was both guided (by teachers, experts in the field and real entrepreneurs) and self-regulated. As to the tools adopted in the project, the experimental courses showed that Serious Games represent a suitable tool for sustaining Entrepreneurship Education. Besides, the appropriateness and effectiveness of the use of Serious Games for the intended purposes, the experiments conducted also demonstrated the suitability of the adopted blended learning/teaching methodology for sustaining student motivation and ultimately for improving learning",blended learning;entrepreneurship education;game based learning;gamification;technology enhanced learning,computer games;curricula;education;education computing;engineering education;students;blended learning;entrepreneurship education;game-based learning;gamification;technology enhanced learning;teaching,"Antonaci, A., Dagnino, F.M., Ott, M., Lavagnino, E., Bellotti, F., Berta, R., De Gloria, A., Deliverable 6.2 Final pedagogical plans (2014) Public Deliverable, , http://www.esg-project.eu, eSG Project, online; Antonaci, A., Dagnino, F.M., Ott, M., Lavagnino, E., Bellotti, F., Berta, R., De Gloria, A., (2015) Aspects of a Field Experience in Entrepreneurship Education, , http://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/en/article/Innovation-entrepreneurship-and-education-In-Depth-41-4?paper=169497, e-Learning papers, online; Bellotti, F., Berta, R., De Gloria, A., Lavagnino, E., Antonaci, A., Dagnino, F., Ott, M., Mayer, I.S., Serious games and the development of an entrepreneurial mindset in higher education engineering students (2014) Entertainment Computing, 5 (4), pp. 357-366; Bellotti, F., Dagnino, F.M., Lavagnino, E., Ott, M., Berta, R., De Gloria Alessandro, S.N., Antonaci, A., A Gamified Short Course for Promoting Entrepreneurship: Results from a field experience with Electronic Engineering Students British Journal of Educational Technology, , in press; Bonk, C.J., Graham, C.R., (2006) The Handbook of Blended Learning Environments: Global Perspectives, Local Designs, , Jossey-Bass/Pfeiffer, San Francisco; Bottino, R.M., Earp, J., Olimpo, G., Ott, M., Pozzi, F., Tavella, M., Supporting the design of pilot learning activities with the Pedagogical Plan Manager (2008) Learning to Live in the Knowledge Society, pp. 37-44. , M.

Primarily the changes are driven by the way millennial students prefer to learn and this is largely the result of learning technologies that have created a new culture of learning from online resources especially from personal devices. In addition, higher education institutions are also facing demands from potential employers who only wish to hire graduates with the right set of skills. Commonly referred to as 21st century skills, this includes, among others, being effective communicators, problem solvers, critical thinkers and effective collaborators. Hence, educators are asked to consider using more appropriate approaches in the “classroom,” be it physical or virtual, so as to produce graduates who will be able to support the needs of today’s employers in particular and also to be able to function in an increasingly globalized or competitive world. The 21st century graduate should be one who will experience learning activities that will ignite and engage them so that they will be guided to learn deeper. It used to be through learning experiences that would take them through a variety of learning strategies. The paper will address the need and highlight some of the latest developments in education. It will also suggest some of the relevant strategies such as blended learning and flipped learning as ways to integrate and engage students for deep learning.

The research project is aiming to make explicit the assumptions and decisions for the design of digital learning resources that would support blended learning in both academia and industry. In particular, we try to understand the influence of human, organizational and didactical aspects on the design of common learning resources for academia and industry. Using design based research methodology, we have engineered an e-learning module in geostatistics, in real world settings and in collaboration with instructors from industry and faculty members from university. The learning resource, a self-paced tutorial, has been used for blended learning in several institutions: one Higher Education Institution (HEI), three companies and one public research institute so far. The study represents ten blended courses, five at HEI and five professional trainings. In total, 126 students and 31 employees were given the opportunity to use the module. It represents around 120 hours of online learning. The investigation involved mixed research methods, both quantitative and qualitative, to gather and analyze data: interviews, questionnaires and also web analytics to understand how the learners used the online resource. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first one, we account for the noticeable differences in the observations made within the academic and corporate contexts. To begin, we recall some descriptive statistics concerning the instructors and the learners: their satisfaction level, their preferences and how they used the e-tutorial, including their scores from two embedded quizzes. Besides, we run more advanced statistical analysis, as non-parametric and parametric tests, to understand if statistically significant differences can be found between the groups. When significant differences are found, we use the available qualitative data to further refine the analysis and guide us through an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). In the second part of the paper, we discuss possible interpretations of these differences and link them to learning theories and principles. We refer to the Knowles? principles for adult learning, to situated cognition and to multimedia learning. All three theoretical frameworks have been found relevant in order to explain some observed differences between the academic and corporate populations of learners and instructors. To finish, we conclude with the possible impact the differences can imply on the Instructional Design (ID) of common resources for blended learning between HEI and industry",business collaboration;university,design;education;engineering research;factor analysis;statistical methods;surveys;teaching;business collaboration;descriptive statistics;digital learning resources;exploratory factor analysis (efa);higher education institutions;public research institute;statistically significant difference;university;e-learning,"Crepon, R., Common learning resources for academia & industry (2013) Proc. of the SEFI Conference, , SEFI, Leuven, Belgium; Crepon, R., Application of design research methodology to a context-sensitive study in EE (2014) Proc. of the FIE Conference IEEE Madrid, Spain; Crepon, R., Description of an e-learning tutorial in geostatistics delivered at one university and at one company (2014) Proc. of the SEFI Conference, , SEFI, Birmingham, UK; Field, A., (2012) Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics, , 4th ed Sage Publications, Ltd, London; Knowles, M.S., Holton, E.F., Swanson, R.A., (2012) The Adult Learner, , 7th ed Routledge, New York; Mayer, R.E., (2009) Multimedia Learning, , 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, New York; Mayer, R.E., (2014) The Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning, , 2nd Edition, Cambridge, University Press, New York; Robbins, P., Aydede, M., (2009) The Cambridge Handbook of Situated Cognition, Cambridge, , University Press, New York","Proc SEFI Annu Conf - Divers Eng Educ: Oppor Face New Trends Eng, SEFI",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84968901926,1,1.0,Spain,Spain,universidad complutense de madrid,universidad complutense de madrid,academia;account;adult;analysis;analysis efa;analytics;analyze;analyze data;aspects;assumptions;available qualitative;begin;cognition;collaboration;common learning;common resource;companies;conclude;contexts;corporate context;corporate population;courses;current paper;data;decisions;descriptive;descriptive statistic;design;design id;didactical aspect;differences;digital;digital learning;discuss;education;education institution;efa;employee;employees;explain;explicit;exploratory;exploratory factor;factor;factor analysis;faculty;faculty member;finish;found;frameworks;gather;general research;geostatistics;groups;guide;guide u;hei;hour;hours;human;id;impact;imply;industry;influence;institute;institution;institution hei;institutions;instructional design;instructors;interpretations;interviews;investigation;knowles;learners;level;link;members;methodology;methods;mixed research;module;multimedia;multimedia learning;noticeable difference;observations;online;online learning;online resource;opportunity;order;paper;parametric;parametric test;part;parts;populations;possible impact;possible interpretation;preferences;principles;professional training;project;public;public research;qualitative;qualitative data;quantitative;questionnaires;quizzes;real world;recall;refer;refine;relevant;research;research institute;research method;research methodology;research project;research work;resource;resources;satisfaction;satisfaction level;scores;second part;settings;several institution;significant difference;statistic concerning;statistical analysis;statistics;student;students;study;support;ten;tests;theoretical framework;theories;trainings;try;tutorial;understand;university;use;web;web analytics;work;world,academia;common learning;industry;practice;resources;theory,277

We carried out a qualitative analysis of two different cases at two different tertiary institutions. One case took place in a virtual mode, the other developed in blended conditions. Data sources were (1) the instructors’ own design of assessment practices, (2) semi-structured interviews to instructors and students, and (3) discursive written exchanges between participants in the virtual space at different stages of the assessment process. The design of activities which allow peer-to-peer communication to be tracked is the most crucial element for the development of a high level of learning transparency. Although substantial learning transparency does not automatically enhance the instructor’s feedback, it may result in a more comprehensive students’ needs analysis as well as a better adjusted and timely support. Practical recommendations regarding these results are considered.

This study uses an established quantitative field observation method to evaluate engagement during students’ use of a new version of an online learning system (Reasoning Mind’s Genie 3). Improvements to Genie 3’s design intended to increase engagement include: using virtual small-group tutoring environment, separating text and speech, and using indicators to focus students’ attention. In this study, Genie 3 classrooms outperformed a traditional classroom on key indicators of engagement, including time on-task, engaged concentration, and boredom. These results have important implications for further improvements to Reasoning Mind, for the design of other online learning systems, and for general pedagogical practices.

Action research was used as the method. Data were gathered using the techniques of up-and-down panorama, Wordle and class diaries, while conducting teacher training for mentoring actions in a discipline involving blended learning. The participants’ testimonies indicated dissatisfaction with use of the traditional teaching model; the importance placed on teachers being open to new things; and also that use of innovative teaching processes was considered to be an important strategy for changing the educational paradigm. The process of training university teachers was shown to be effective with regard to raising awareness among these individuals about the importance of introducing teaching into the agenda of the university’s priorities.

The study is contextualized in some of the relevant theory, and describes a selection of projects across academic levels from the design curriculum at the authors' institution that illustrate a blended approach to digital and physical design pedagogy. Results are presented from a survey of final year students who have experienced this approach, exploring the extent to which these methods are now embedded within their practice. The results suggest that although CAD use is prevalent in their natural practice, and some of the recognized problems associated with it are more evident than in professional CAD users, the students have adopted our approach of designing across digital and physical platforms.

It is essential that these healthcare professionals are trained to the highest level, defined as European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning (EQF) level 8 by the European Commission's Radiation Protection Report 174 'Guidelines on the MPE'. The main objective of the EUTEMPE-RX project is to provide a model training scheme that allows the medical physicist in diagnostic and interventional radiology (D&IR) to reach this high level. A European network of partners was brought together in this FP7 EC project to ensure sufficient expertise in all aspects of the subject and to create a harmonised course programme. Targeted participants are medical physicists in D&IR in hospitals, engineers and scientists in medical device industries and officers working in regulatory authorities. Twelve course modules will be developed at EQF level 8, with radiation safety and diagnostic effectiveness being prevalent subjects. The modules will combine online with face-to-face teaching using a blended learning approach.

The implementation of NATO STANAG 6001 examinations meant a breakthrough in language testing and, subsequently, it resulted in positive washback effect on teaching. The advent of e-learning and its massive implementation into teaching languages led to blended learning and gradually to e-testing. In the military, several types of tests are required - placement tests, achievement tests, as well as high-stakes proficiency tests. Since the testing by the above mentioned types of tests can be considered as large-scale assessment, e-testing came into play as an instrument making tests more time- and cost-effective. Both supervised and unsupervised (proctored and unproctored) e-testing has been applied in the language teaching and testing system in the military. This article will provide insight into the implementation of e-testing and present the conclusions of a study comparing the results of supervised and unsupervised e-tests, using both quantitative and qualitative approaches.

It is critical that programs have curricula objectives linked to educational models that support learning. Using a proven educational modelling process ensures that curricula objectives are met and a solid basis for learning and assessment is achieved.Aim: To develop an educational design model that produces an educationally sound program development plan for use by anyone involved in online course development.Methods: We have described the development of a generic educational model designed for continuing health education programs. The Knowledge, Process, Practice (KPP) model is founded on recognised educational theory and online education practice. This paper presents a step-by-step guide on using this model for program development that encases reliable learning and evaluation.Results: The model supports a three-step approach, KPP, based on learning outcomes and supporting appropriate assessment activities. It provides a program structure for online or blended learning that is explicit, educationally defensible, and supports multiple assessment points for health professionals.Conclusion: The KPP model is based on best practice educational design using a structure that can be adapted for a variety of online or flexibly delivered postgraduate medical education programs.

Key challenges faced by this work are how best to support educational and social interactions, how to deliver personalised tuition, and how to enable effective feedback, all in a way which is potentially scalable to thousands of users. A case study is described involving one to one and group music lessons in an on-campus, face to face, higher education context that were observed and analysed in terms of the actions carried out by the participants. The actions are described and it is shown how they can be formalised into a flowchart which represents the social interactions and activities within a lesson. Through this analysis, specific scenarios emerged where the feedback being given might not be effective, e.g the recipient not understanding the feedback or the provision of feedback which is not specific enough. In answer to these scenarios of ineffective feedback, the requirements for a technological intervention which aims to make the feedback more effective are proposed. With this in mind, we are then able to describe a novel technological platform which has been developed as part of a large-scale European research project and which aims to support effective feedback. The platform is based around focused discussion of time based media, embedded within existing teaching activities at a research led higher education institution in the UK. We outline how it is being used in a blended learning model to support the teaching and learning of music. We reflect on the experience of developing techniques and systems for enabling communities of e-learning and describe our evaluation methodology which involves several case studies and approximately 400 users in its current phase.

The Digital natives or the Net-generation are now enrolling university programmes and they are the first generation that has used computers and online tools since childhood. Programming education has a tradition of programming huts, where students in introductory programming courses get exercises to explore fundamental programming concepts with instant feedback. To provide quality feedback in the traditional form requires experienced facilitators and costly venues for today's large course batches. At the department where this study has been conducted there exists a tradition of a weekly lab hut for general Computer science but an online environment with 24/7 access would be an enhancement. This study has explored the potential of an online environment for programming exercises in the Python programming language named MyProgrammingLab. The aim of the study is to describe and discuss how an online programming laboratory might support the learning of programming concepts in introductory university courses. The research strategy has been a case study where data has been collected by an evaluation questionnaire, informal discussions and an analysis of students' study patterns in the virtual learning environment. Findings indicate that students have different learning styles and that some students have worked thoroughly with most of the material in MyProgrammingLab, but that the majority only have used the environment for the initial exercises on fundamental programming concepts. Some learners also mention that they got stuck in the online environment and that they lack the feedback that they can get in tradition face-to-face sessions. Conclusions are that the evaluated online environment can be a valuable extra tool for self-learning, but to reach a larger part of the course participants with their various learning styles there is a need for a closer alignment to the course content which would need a different course outline",blended learning;e-learning;online learning environment;programming education;technology enhanced learning,computer aided instruction;computer programming;curricula;education;engineering education;online systems;students;blended learning;introductory programming course;learning-of-programming;online learning environment;programming education;python programming language;technology enhanced learning;virtual learning environments;e-learning,"Brekke, M., Early Testing of e-Exams in Calculus at University Level, In EDEN 2013 Annual Conference, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway, 12-15 June 2013 (2013), pp. 625-632. , European Distance and E-Learning Network;

This is a consequence of the incorporation of previous degree structures into the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) consolidation process. In this chapter, we describe our experience in the use of blended-learning methodology and also look at some possible drawbacks its implementation may bring. In the next few lines, we summarize the theoretical bases for our methodology and we offer a review of current literature on blended-learning. We also describe a series of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools and the way in which they have been used in different modules in the Degree of English Studies at the Facultat de Filologia, Traduccio i Comunicacio of the Universitat de Valencia. Our objective is to point out the advantages and drawbacks of the implementation of the ICTs employed in our degree through the description of our own experience. We try to demonstrate how their implementation has acted as a powerful catalyst for higher achievement. After that, we give a brief overview of the topic of competence assessment and show an example of its adaptation in order to evaluate one of the ICT tools we describe. Finally, we offer some suggestions on the use of ICTs and map out some future directions for research.

The chapter focuses on a heuristic, mindful learning method set in a blended learning environment of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) at the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain. Various task-based examples are provided to demonstrate that a mindful, collaborative and creative learning approach that allows for reflection, participation and autonomy can contribute to enhance ESP competences effectively. On the one hand, this chapter analyses the different communicative tasks that enabled learners to be collaborative and creative in class and online. On the other hand, the results will corroborate that active participants of their learning process create knowledge that is closed to their own spaces. Creation and collaboration for ESP students have benefits that contribute to a successful communicative approach of foreign language and ITC competences.

Feedback mechanism about learning engagement could be a source of assessment for the educators and the students. In online learning, not only the educators but also the students need to get informed about their learning engagements as cyberspace is not controllable for the educators and students could be in interaction with any content or human agency without teacher guidance and in this context, feedback based on analytical assessment is essential for the self-learning activities. Sometimes, in online group discussions, the teachers may not decide when to interrupt the ongoing discussions and in parallel with this, the students in a learning group may be in a vicious circle and repeatedly discussing the same topic without any advancement whereas critical thinking skills require adaptation of some instructional strategies. In these occasions, learning analytics (LA) is a key process to provide educational stakeholders with evidence based, analytical and contextual outcomes in a way of making sense of their learning engagements. In this conceptual framework, our research has attempted to examine sequential analysis as a likely method to get adapted by LA researchers with its prospects, opportunities and challenges. To this end, we focused on a part of a blended learning course and analyzed the students' online discussions to examine the method of sequential analysis with its potential to be an efficient tool to conduct learning analytics. The outcomes of this study have implications for the design of an online learning environment as well as LA as an emerging area.

This chapter explores the use of a design process of an iterative model with frequent evaluation of the process to ensure strong design in blended and flexible learning. Two case studies are used to demonstrate how the ADDIE process is used in an iterative method to develop simulations to teach and refine professional practice in distance learning situations, from both a course and subject perspective. The authors argue that if a strong development and evaluation process is followed, sustainable simulations can be developed. Results show that students have a positive response to simulation use in learning and appreciate a well structured simulation to aid in professional practice development.

With the development of information technology, the network environment has become one of the important environments for learners to study. Autonomous learning and collaborative learning, which are based on network environment, will become indispensable ways of future learning. This paper analyzes the basic theory of blended learning, discusses the meaning and relationship of autonomous learning and collaborative learning, and analyzes the advantages of autonomous and collaborative learning brought by network. Then with teaching practice, this paper builds a web-based autonomous and collaborative teaching model under blended learning. Finally, the paper gives a detailed description in designing teaching process, module structure, functions and system architecture of web-based autonomous and collaborative teaching model. The analysis shows that applying this model to course teaching has some influence and practical significance to enrich and improve the teaching pattern.

In the current way of using this term, the term itself it obsolete. The missing point is a clear definition of what exactly the 'blend' is. In many cases, blended learning is used to describe scenarios where traditional classroom education is enriched with technology, aka. Elearning.

Nowadays, we have the opportunity not only to apply 'traditional' methods but also to use more sophisticated approaches such as e-learning and blended learning (BL) to provide more effective and flexible ways of delivering knowledge to students. E-learning can become a very effective part of 'blended learning' where a part of the course content is delivered online.

In a programming course, the learning level of a learner will be determined in the process of tackling the various problem situations through learner's own coding and error handling. It is required to provide the course to learners, which students feel that it is easy and interesting to write coding by considering learners' coding level. For this, we make a teacher give some feedback to a learner after taking questions in the form of classifying the errors of assignments. We expect that the blended learning system developed in this study will reduce learners who quit to solve a assignment and eventually improve learning achievement by steps because there are an adaptive interactions between a learner and a teacher to help to solve the various difficulties in doing an assignment.

The blended-learning course is part of the initial study phase smoothing the transition to learning at university level. The instructional design of the preparatory course is aligned with that of the Bachelor's study program. However, it takes place prior to the beginning of the first semester. The initial phase additionally encompasses the whole first semester with different courses meant to help students getting ready for studying. Prospective students indicated that they needed to refresh their knowledge in mathematics. Thus, a preparatory mathematics course was given priority. This course serves several purposes: Students get an impression of the requirements in mathematics necessary for the study program; they refresh their basic knowledge; they make themselves familiar with self-organized learning and the blended-learning concept of the program. Design and implementation were evaluated with a questionnaire at the end of the course. The results show that the course is an appropriate instrument prior to engineering studies in order to prepare and support non-traditional students.

They have altered common approaches to teaching and learning. In fact, nowadays, anyone can now learn anything from anyone at anytime. Moreover, the 21st century learners cannot imagine their studies without being able to interact with the online materials or their peers. Owing to these facts, the terminology in the area of education is also constantly changing and being innovated. Particularly with the arrival of new technologies, many new terms have emerged such as eLearning, on-line learning, blended learning or computer base learning. Out of these approaches the best seems to be blended learning. Blended learning is nowadays perceived as not only a mere combination of face-to-face and online learning, but as a combination of training methodologies, which uses the best delivery method for the successful achievement of the learning objective. It requires not only a flexible and experienced teacher/ tutor, but also a self-regulated/ autonomous learner. The teacher is not an authority in the class anymore. S/he should only teach/ navigate his/ her learners how to process and form scientific knowledge and enquiry. Therefore, this article focuses on blended learning as one of the current forms of instruction in the teaching of foreign languages. It explores its definition, principles, methodology and its relevancy for the teaching of English. Furthermore, it emphasizes an irreplaceable position of a teacher in this process. In addition, the authors provide a few specific examples in which the blended form is used. Finally, they present a survey among the Czech and Kazakh students about their preferred form of instruction in the learning of English in order to verify whether the blended form of instruction is welcomed or not by students in their learning of English",blended learning;english;forms of instruction;students;survey,computational linguistics;education;engineering education;social networking (online);students;surveying;surveys;teaching;autonomous learners;blended learning;english;information and communication technologies;learning objectives;on-line materials;scientific knowledge;teaching and learning;e-learning,"Brown, H.D., (1987) Principles of language learning and teaching, , Prantice-Hall; Bruffee, K., (1993) Collaborative learning, , Baltimore: The John Hopkins University Press; Cech, P., Klimova, B., Kurz Teaching written business English (TWBE) (2003) Sbornik prispevku ze seminare a souteze e-learning 2003, pp. 23-26. , J.

While TEL can provide many benefits for learners, many staff struggle to develop the skills and understanding necessary to design, develop and deliver high quality learning in these environments. Peer review of teaching and learning is acknowledged as a powerful professional learning tool for online and blended learning environments that can be utilised to assist staff to develop their skills in relation to teaching and learning. Peer review can be particularly powerful in recognising and addressing specific areas for professional learning about one's teaching practice. However, staff can find such approaches judgmental and focused on metrics and show reluctance to participate in such activities. There is also a view that once a development task such as peer review becomes formalised, the meaning of development is changed lessening the benefits of engagement in the process. This paper reports on a work in progress relating to a funded Australian Government Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT) project in two universities that piloted a reciprocal 'learning conversation' approach to peer review. This approach encourages the development of an ongoing dialogue around teaching and learning that goes beyond an exchange of facts and ideas and creates an opportunity for mutual and reciprocal learning - a collaborative as opposed to a developmental model of peer learning. The paper provides a definition of peer learning, examines the literature in relation to peer review of online teaching, and provides a rational for exploring ""learning conversations"" as an approach to peer review. It outlines the project features, processes, and progress to date.

The development of information and communication technologies has made it possible to easily create, modify and publish the visual and multimedia materials. The internet is becoming a learning environment in which educational content can be presented in a different form consisting of the text, hypertext, digital images, multimedia, hypermedia, etc. In this paper the authors discuss the possibility of using an image as a media content in the educational process in the context of the design space for blended learning. They present the results of research on the level of use of visual materials in academic practice and evaluation of their effectiveness by students. They point to the role of visual skills and visual knowledge as components of cultural capital of modern man, also pay attention to the learning potential inherent in the image as an independent unit of knowledge.

The strategy is based on the main principles of blended learning and the analysis of the results of experiments with students from different faculties. Various tests were carried out to identify students' levels of knowledge and preferences in their learning process based on their learning styles. Throughout the experiment, students were divided into groups according to the test outcomes. Separate groups were formed of students with different levels of knowledge and learning styles, determined using the Felder-Silverman model. Adaptive learning tools were provided for the students considering the three main aspects: students' background, the level of their prior knowledge and their preferred learning style. The success of the strategy presented in this article is demonstrated by comparing the achievements of the test group with the reference group, who were not taught using the new strategies.

As blended learning becomes part of design education, a rise in digital technologies allows an innovative thinking approach to eLearning that includes eMaking. This has the potential to have a transformative effect on learning, making it possible to move to a more collaborative form of learning as students and lecturers explore the possibilities of new technologies together, supporting a change in the relationship of students to lecturers, and a change in attitude to the way students see themselves and their own learning.

First, 100 EFL teachers completed the Teacher Technology Integration Survey developed by Vannatta and Banister (2009), to help estimate technology use in EFL classes. Then the researchers interviewed twelve teachers, comprising two EFL teacher educators with no CALL experience, four teachers with the experience of integrating technology in their EFL classes, four EFL teachers who had recently finished an online CALL teacher education program, and two EFL teachers with no CALL experience. The semi-structured interview questions were designed by the researchers, one of whom has extensive experience with CALL, and were revised based on the suggestions of a colleague with expertise in teacher education. One of the researchers conducted the interviews, each of which lasted for 30-50 minutes. The researchers used structural content analysis of the interview transcripts to find themes relevant to the research question. The results suggest that on the whole, Iranian EFL teachers do not usually integrate digital technology into their classes; and the obstacles in implementing CALL in language classrooms could be classified into three categories: teacher, facility, and learner constraints. Each of the categories is discussed in detail and suggestions are provided for promoting CALL in the Iranian context.

The purpose of this study was to test the effects of voluntary participation in extracurricular instruction with a pencast on student learning. Dental and dental hygiene students were given instruction in a complex physiological topic using lecture and static slides. An Internet link to a pencast that covered the complex topic in a more temporally contiguous fashion was also provided for voluntary review. The students were given a multiple-choice exam that consisted of retention and transfer test questions. Sixty-nine percent of the students who did not watch the pencast and 89 percent of the students who watched the pencast answered the retention test question correctly (p=0.08). Fifty-four percent of the students who did not watch the pencast and 90 percent of the students who watched the pencast answered the transfer test question correctly (p=0.005). This finding indicates that students who watched the pencast performed better on a transfer test, a measurement of meaningful learning, than students who received only the narrated instruction with static images. This supports the hypothesis that temporally contiguous instruction promotes more meaningful learning than lecture accompanied only by static slide images",blended learning;dental education;dental hygiene education;educational technology;pencasts;respiratory physiology;transfer tests,"article;attitude to computers;blended learning;dental education;dental hygiene education;education;educational technology;equipment;human;learning;methodology;mouth hygiene;multimedia;pencasts;physiology;respiratory function;teaching;time;transfer tests;blended learning;dental education;dental hygiene education;educational technology;pencasts;respiratory physiology;transfer tests;attitude to computers;computer-assisted instruction;education, dental;educational measurement;educational technology;humans;learning;multimedia;oral hygiene;physiology;respiratory physiological processes;time factors","(2012) Livescribe Celebrates Five Years of Digital Writing, , www.livescribe.com/blog/press/?p=6708, May 23, Accessed: February 12, 2013; Mayer, R.E., (2009) Multimedia Learning, , 2nd ed.

Key challenges faced by this work are how best to support educational and social interactions, how to deliver personalised tuition, and how to enable effective feedback, all in a way which is potentially scalable to thousands of users. A case study is described involving one to one and group music lessons in an on-campus, face to face, higher education context that were observed and analysed in terms of the actions carried out by the participants. The actions are described and it is shown how they can be formalised into a flowchart which represents the social interactions and activities within a lesson. Through this analysis, specific scenarios emerged where the feedback being given might not be effective, e.g. the recipient not understanding the feedback or the provision of feedback which is not specific enough. In answer to these scenarios of ineffective feedback, the requirements for a technological intervention which aims to make the feedback more effective are proposed. With this in mind, we are then able to describe a novel technological platform which has been developed as part of a large-scale European research project and which aims to support effective feedback. The platform is based around focused discussion of time based media, embedded within existing teaching activities at a research led higher education institution in the UK. We outline how it is being used in a blended learning model to support the teaching and learning of music. We reflect on the experience of developing techniques and systems for enabling communities of elearning and describe our evaluation methodology which involves several, ongoing case studies and approximately 400 users in its current phase.

The so called 'blended learning' method combines face to face education and a digital forum called SketchLab where students can watch instructional movies (SketchTube) and discuss their designs with each other but also with teachers. The first results of using SketchLab are promising. Students encouraged each other to improve their skills and implement new techniques and the activity on SketchLab continued also after the workshops. The use of this specific digital sketching forum led to more activity in the design process of students and encouraged them to improve their sketching techniques and to become better designers,blended learning;design education;digital media;sketching;sketching forum;sketchlab,blended learning;design education;sketching;sketching forum;sketchlab;digital storage;e-learning;product design;teaching;students,"Garrison, D.R., (2011) E-learning in the 21st Century: A Framework for Research and Practice, , Taylor and Francis e-library, New York; Gilbert, J., Morton, S., Rowley, J., E-learning: The student experience (2007) British Journal of Educational Technology, 38 (4), pp. 560-573; Minutephysics, , http://www.youtube.com/minutephysics, 2013 10 february; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eKc5kgPVrA&list= PLED25F943F8D6081C&index=3, Available from; Kose, U., A blended learning model supported with web 2.0 technologies (2010) Procedia- Social and Behavioral Science, 2 (2), pp. 2794-2802; Waanders, R.M., Eggink, W., Mulder-Nijkamp, M., Sketching is more than making correct drawings (2011) International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, pp. 299-303. , 8&9 september, London, (City University); Nijkamp, M., Garde, J.A., A practical approach to translating social cultural patterns into new design International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, , 2-3 september, Trondheim, Norway; Dorst, K., Design research: A revolution-waiting-to-happen International Association of Societies of Design Research, , 14 november Hong Kong; Corremans, J.A.M., Measuring the effectiveness of a design method to generate form alternatives: An experiment performed with freshmen studentes product development (2011) Journal of Engineering Design, 22 (4), pp. 259-274; Shah, J.J., Smith, S., Vargas-Hernandez, N., Metrics for measuring ideation effectiveness (2003) Design Studies, 24 (2), pp. 111-134; Yang, M.C., Concept generating and sketching: Correlations with design outcome ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences, , 2-6 september Chicago, Illinois USA","Proc Int Conf Eng Prod Des Educ: Des Educ - Grow Our Future, EPDE",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891285637,2,0.5,Netherlands,Netherlands,university of twente,university of twente,activity;application;become;chances;combine face;combines;course;design;design education;design process;designers;designs;digital;digital forum;digital learning;digital sketching;discuss;education;face;face education;forum;implement;implementation;instructional movie;means;method;method combine;movie sketchtube;movies;new opportunity;new technique;opportunities;paper;process;promising;results;sketching technique;sketchlab;sketchtube;skills;specific digital;students;teachers;techniques;use;watch;watch instructional;workshops,design;design skill;digital;digital medium;education;media;sketchtube;skills,335

By examining the processes by which supervisors and their students on a two-year part-time masters in Applied eLearning negotiated the blended approach adopted to supervision, it illustrates the conditions that enable connections to occur and flourish. The socio-technical context for supervision was supported using learning technologies (VLE, research wikis and ePortfolios), small group supervision (two to three supervisors and students) and traditional individual supervision. Qualitative data were obtained through surveys and focus groups, and analysed using a framework which drew on connectivist principles. Findings suggest that for increased connections between supervisors and their students, a sense of sanctuary, community and regulation within the supervision process is important; the role of technologies in unifying postgraduate supervision in professional development are discussed.

This simulator implements linear low-order process models (first order, second order and third order), open-loop architecture and closed-loop architecture with a linear PID feedback controller. At the past, a hardware simulator (HW123b) for the three process models was developed in our group, and now the equivalent software version is presented. Modeling and dynamical simulation are now basic tools for understanding and verifying theoretical subjects. The main contribution is a Java application that can be used by the instructor / user in a blended learning environment to teach / learn the basic notions of dynamical systems behavior and also the effect of PID feedback controllers in the closed-loop system.

The research was conducted with 305 foreign learners who were atending a language centre in Ankara to learn Turkish. The research utilised the ""Needs Analysis Questionnaire for Learners of Turkish as a Foreign Language"" that was developed by the researchers, and which analysed seven dimensions of the learning process: ""themes, learning styles, language skills, learning environments, materials, out-of-class activities and assessment"". The findings obtained through the questionnaire were calculated as frequencies and percentages. The findings of the research revealed that learners of Turkish as a foreign language are most interested in topics related to the Turkish culture, their own country and their work/job. It was also determined that the learners preferred audio-visual activities, watching videos or small group discussions in the language learning process. From the analysis of learner needs related to learning environments, it was seen that the learners preferred blended learning, but were adverse to a totally e-learning-based environment. For assessment, it was determined that the learners opposed self-assessment or peer assessment, but rather preferred to have the teacher assess their writen/spoken work",learner-centred language education;needs analysis;teaching turkish as a foreign language,,"Aydoǧdu, C., Yabanci dil oǧretiminde otonom oǧrenme: Neden ve nasil?

Firstly, it discusses functions of language as a lingua franca from a sociolinguistic perspective, in particular considering the concept of the ownership of ELF. Secondly, it draws on sociocultural theory of second language learning. In the situated learning approach second language learning is viewed as a functional and regulatory process in attaining an identity of a member of a community of practice. Such a view is applied to ELF and is exemplified by three international educational projects: an MA blended learning project under this author’s supervision and two larger international projects, one involving two partner countries and the other—eight partner countries. TheMAproject and the international projects (The European Master for European Teacher Training Project— EMETT and a Polish-Ukrainian project on the Development of Intercultural Competence through English—DICE) serve as illustrations of the claim that English is used nowadays by non-native users of English first of all to suit their own purposes. What is of primary significance is communication between the international participants and implementation of the project goals. It is argued that non-native ELF users in international projects can be empowered in their use of English by their sense of legitimate ownership of English that stems from their necessity to use a common language in oral, digital and written communication. Implications are drawn for English language teaching and learning in Europe.

At Charles Darwin University in the Northern Territory, Australia, the social work and humanitarian studies degree-level programmes are delivered in blended mode involving a combination of face-to-face and online learning. Within these modes of delivery students are presented with questions and activities drawn from our practice partners to bring 'real world relevance' to learning. Drawing from examples provided by the practice settings in which the students wish to work after they graduate, we have found that this relationship between the academy and practice agency effectively bridges the gap between the worlds of theory and practice for our students. In a community of learning model, students elect to work on local practice partners' projects throughout the semester. This mix of academia working in partnership with frontline social and humanitarian workers brings immediacy to the learning. Opportunities for 'deep learning' are facilitated by this partnership approach. The implications for using communities of learning models for engaging students from two professions in online activities are discussed.

E-Business Application in higher education has already become an indispensable tool in both university staff and students' daily life. A number of technological, educational and business models of e-Business application in higher education have been developed. However, the educational models of e-Business application in higher education mostly focus on blended learning, thereby they lack the blended educational process that comprises blended teaching, peer-learning and learning. These one-sided educational models do not contribute to the qualitative blended educational process for the improvement of students' learning achievements. Aim of the present paper is to work out the educational model of e-Business application in higher education underpinning analysis of quality of the institutionalized blended educational process for the improvement of students' learning achievements. The meaning of the key concepts e-Business application and blended learning is studied. Moreover, the logical chain of analysis is shown: e-Business → blended learning → a model of the blended educational process → empirical study within a multicultural environment. The results of the present research show that students' learning achievements after having been implemented the blended educational process have been enhanced. Directions of further research are proposed.

Blended learning master's student talking about Solent Online Learning. The authors carried out an extended project aimed at making effective use of the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for the delivery of high-quality online distance and blended learning. This was in response to a greater demand for such courses through the emergence of a new constituency of learner, principally professional learners, those already in employment but seeking to improve their level of qualification and employability through the study of flexibly delivered credit bearing courses. The growth of this constituency can be seen very much as a response to the changes to the funding structure in the higher education sector in the UK. To this end, the authors worked within a team that developed an approach to effective course design, the Solent Online Learning Standard, and then a new methodology for collaborating with academic staff in the development and delivery of such courses. In order to best facilitate this, the team also created a new instance of its institutional VLE, called Solent Online Learning and tailored more to the needs of these new professional learners.

Tutors at the CIS Sandbox, a collaborative learning lab at an American university, offered a series of Crunch Sessions to their peers. This paper examines how these sessions model characteristics of peer tutoring, and describes how social media and Internet-based collaboration tools support a blended learning environment where an in-person event is aligned with a web presence. Interviews with student tutors and participants suggest that the peer relationship between tutors and tutees was conducive to an open exchange of questions and answers among participants, and that the sessions contributed to student learning for those who attended.

The findings are mainly based on the case studies of ten pilot local learning hubs in the Beskidy Mountains, Poland. The results of four subsequent projects supported by different EU programs and conducted from 2006 to 2013 contributed to this study. These projects were conducted in Poland and 16 other countries of European Research Area (ERA). We will present the learning and research goals as well as the predominant learning scenarios. We will also show how innovative local social networks emerged to foster web-based and blended learning. A common feature of all the learning hubs was the need to use DVB-RCS bidirectional satellite internet technology for learning. We will present a multicriteria performance evaluation of the learning hubs in connection with their learning goals, adopted scenarios, and future development prospects.

In addition to traditional face-to-face, collaborative environments, the widespread use of information and communication technologies allows individuals around the globe to participate in collaborative learning. Dillenbourg emphasizes the need to differentiate the 'notion of culture' in the context of intercultural group learning, with that of developing a common ground or 'micro-culture' through which to successfully interact. The importance of building a micro-culture is echoed by Ashcraft and Treadwell, as the basis for successful collaborative learning. This article highlights the experiences of a university based, intercultural, mixed methods research project at Master's degree level, where student researchers with diverse backgrounds, worked collaboratively to create a tentative conceptual framework, in order to map research trends at the 2010 American Educational Research Association conference. This article suggests that collaborative learning in intercultural groups, rather than benefiting from one approach over another, can actually be enhanced by the combining of methods, resulting in a deeper learning experience for those participating. Furthermore, in the initial stages of negotiating and re-negotiating collective understandings and meaning, face-to-face collaboration can provide a basis for deeper learning and understanding in subsequent online collaboration, as experienced by the intercultural collective research group, which is the case study of this article.

Reliable and robust infrastructure must be in place to support students and faculty. Continuous evaluation can effectively track the impact of blended learning on students, faculty, and the institution. These data are used to inform stakeholders and impact policy to improve faculty development and other support structures necessary for success. This iterative loop of continuous quality improvement is augmented by faculty scholarship of teaching and learning research. The evolution of blended learning at the University of Central Florida is used as a model and research collected over sixteen years illustrates that with proper support and planning, blended learning can result in positive institutional transformation.

The relevant decrease in classroom teaching hours for new Degrees is giving way to an ever-increasing growth in independent self-study which is slowly taking the lead. The teacher should confront and manage this new reality effectively and perhaps a good way to do so may be to extend in-class teaching to a virtual classroom environment through on-line training, specifically designed for this purpose. Students seem to feel at home with this type of training. An opinion poll, carried out among students that have completed a subject of the degree (Financial Mathematics) through blended-learning, analyzes student views on several teaching aspects of this hybridlearning methods, compares it to other more traditional University teaching methods and evaluates the possible incidence of the different student profiles on their learning preferences",blended learning;ehea;teaching-learning;university,,"Area Moreira, M., La ensenanza universitaria en tiempos de cambio: El papel de las bibliotecas en la innovacion educativa (2006) IV Jomadas CRN de REBIUN, pp. 1-32. , Universidad de Burgos; Belanger, F., Jordan, D., (2000) Evaluation and Implementation of Distance Learning: Technologies, Tools and Techniques, , Londres, Idea Group Publishing; Boyle, T., Bradley, C., Chalk, P., Jones, R., Pickard, P., Using blended learning to improve student success rates in learning to program (2003) Journal of Educational Media, 28, pp. 165-178; (2005) A Framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area, , BOLOGNA WORKING GROUP ON QUALIFICATIONS FRAMEWORKS, Copenhagen, Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation; Coderch, J., Guitert, M., ¿Como aprender y ensenar con Internet?

The aim of this work was to provide the results of the course Introduction to Distance Education in the form of reference. For training, we used the Moodle platform of the University of Granma (http://eddist.udg.co.cu) affording communication between facilitators and course participants. The training, attended by 22 professionals from different places. In consultations with tutors, satisfaction was high and the subject provided is highly welcomed. Learners, expressed a great satisfaction and highlighted the high professional level of teachers, so they decided to re-engage in this type of training. We conclude that this modality and especially the B-learning is effective for training of professionals and the Virtual Classroom University of Granma is an appropriate space for the training of human capital of the veterinary sciences",blended learning;distance education;training;veterinary sciences,,"Andres, J., Chiappe, A., Lopez, C., Blended Learning y estilos de aprendizaje en estudiantes universitarios del area de la salud (2012) Revista de Educacion Medica Superior, 26 (1), pp. 27-44; Antunez, G., Ramirez, W., Rodriguez, Y., Flores, A., Stanchi, N., Rejas, J., La formacion online desde el Aula Virtual Veterinaria: Resultados y experiencias (2009) Revista Vet de Cuyo, 3 (1-2); Antunez, G., Soler, Y., Rodriguez, V., Ramirez, W., Mercado, A., Flores, A., Curso virtual de redaccion cientifica e infotecnologia sobre la plataforma moodle: resultados y experiencias (2012) Pixel-Bit, Revista de Medios y Educacion.

It is acknowledged that simulations used for education, professional development, and training, have a long history of development and use. The focus is on digital simulations (e-simulations) situated in blended learning environments and the improved affordances of the newer digital media used via the web to enhance the value of their contribution to learning and teaching in professional and vocationally-oriented fields. This is an area which has received less attention in the whole ""e-learning"" literature compared with the voluminous body of knowledge and practice on computer-mediated communication, online community building, social networking, and various forms of online (usually automated) assessment. A framework of blended e-simulation design is outlined. The chapter concludes by examining what the future might hold for simulations in further and higher education, and ongoing work-based learning.

It is becoming increasingly essential in the agenda of British Higher Education institutions, especially with the tripling of the tuition fee. This chapter focuses on how to engage students with various online activities to improve their proficiency in Chinese as a foreign language. The study shows that students enhanced their learning experience by using voice tools to improve their speaking and listening, by sharing their writing within the learning community, and by documenting their own learning journeys with e-portfolio pages. Using the data from various instruments, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of the tools, analyse and discuss the advantages and problems with blended learning in the context of teaching Chinese as a foreign language.

The methodology combines oncampus and on-line tuition. Existing literature has largely discussed the advantages and disadvantages about blended learning, e-learning communication tools (synchronous and asynchronous), and language learning aided by computers. However, more research is still necessary to notice how students and teachers perceive this methodology in foreign language learning. In this line, the Master's Degree in Bilingual Education at Nebrija University (Spain), which is wholly run through blended learning, has as a main aim to raise students' level of English from a B2 to a C1. During its first year of implementation, a research was carried out to analyze the participants' opinion on the benefits of the blended-learning tools used for English learning; detect possible deficiencies; and to provide recommendations for future foreign language teaching and learning",blended learning;call;e-learning;foreign language teaching and learning;on-campus and on-line tuition;synchronous and asynchronous communication,,"Albrecht, B., Enriching students experience through blended learning (2006), http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/erb0612.pdf, Accessed 22 June 2012;

It presents the theoretical framework and data of an empirical study conducted at the University of Porto in Portugal involving teachers who won the E-Learning Prize of Excellence in the period between 2006 and 2010. The main objective of this article is to contribute to an understanding of the value of blended learning within the scope of the Bologna Process which began in 2006 in this University. We consider blended learning as a flexible and integrated approach that combines different forms of communication in synchronous and asynchronous moments. To gather data, we conducted survey questionnaires among teachers and students as well as semistructured interviews and document analysis in a cyclical and interactive process of data collection, data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing/verifying. The research results highlight the importance of teacher intervention to create an environment that stimulates processes of cooperation, autonomy, social integration and the development of learning communities, important in this competitive world.

This group of colleagues represented institutions such as the University of Illinois, the University of Central Florida, University of Maryland University College, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and the City University of New York. As the discussion went on, a consensus emerged; they were witnessing a new approach to teaching and learning that was different from either of its basic components. Face-to-face instruction had been around for centuries and fully online instruction had blossomed in the 1990s with the development and ubiquity of the Internet. They observed that there appeared to be no single pattern or model for blending these approaches. Some faculty taught basically a face-to-face course with a small portion of online activities. Others taught essentially online courses with a face-to-face component. In developing online components, various technologies such as interactive and non-interactive media, asynchronous discussion boards and blogs, as well as synchronous conferencing were being utilized to meet specific pedagogical goals and objectives. There were also distinctions in the development and scheduling of faceto-face components, some meeting once a week, others every other week, and still others once a month. This discussion resulted in the idea that a group of knowledgeable individuals from around the country be assembled to discuss “blended learning” and its implications for education. Funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, an invitation only workshop was held in April 2003 at the University of Illinois-Chicago. About 30 individuals met for 2 days and, while many ideas were floated and discussion at times was unwieldy, this group concluded that blended learning was important, needed further investigation, and would likely have significant pedagogical, administrative, and institutional ramifications. A community of professionals was born. Since 2003, this community, under the auspices of the Sloan Consortium, has held an annual workshop, which in 2012 attracted 665 participants.

Past research has shown personal support from a tutor as highly effective, but uneconomical. Might flipped formats be a solution to this economic problem? This paper reports on a flipped design for teaching ancient Greek in a theological college. Students learnt the basic content through online videos and activities, and then attended a two-week intensive to interact with faculty and peers. Students were very satisfied with the online resource and agreed that it had helped them prepare to learn Greek, although they were keen to keep the personal interaction with peers and teachers. They used it heavily for an extended period of time. The proportion of students failing or achieving a simple pass decreased, although more data is required to confirm the impact on marks. Overall, the adoption of a flipped format has been validated.

They have been used with satisfactory results on the instruction of several domains. The authors believe that they could also be useful for the instruction of Secondary Physics and Chemistry Education. Therefore, in this paper, the authors present a procedure to create an agent for that domain. First, teachers have to introduce the exercises with their correct answers. Secondly, students will be presented the exercises, and if the students know the answer, and if it is correct, more difficult exercises will be presented. Otherwise, step-by-step natural language support will be provided to guide the student towards the solution. It is the authors' hypothesis that this innovative teaching method will be satisfactory and useful for teachers and students, and that by following the procedure more computer programmers can be encouraged to develop agents for other domains to be used by teachers and students at class.

The steps of the project were the following: Firstly, the integration of computerized tools in the curriculum of the two university subjects. Secondly, the implementation of this learning experience was based on a corpus of selected texts which were annotated to help and guide students in their work (the World of Texts); and a database used by students to deal with lexical analysis and to record their findings and their knowledge about lexical items from the texts compiled (the Web of Words). By integrating ICT in the teaching process, we expected to foster students’ autonomy and motivation as well as to improve their lexical and semantic competence. The research results suggest that, in the first place, the computer-mediated format increased students’ motivation and encouraged autonomy in the learning process; in addition, it contributed to a better understanding of both subjects.

Studio-based learning is an effective method to provide students with an understanding of the process design cycle and problem-solving techniques. However, learning-by-doing might sometimes not be an efficient method in teaching and learning, for it usually takes a relatively long time to realize the results. Games could simulate a real world situation with condensed experience and controllable details. Introducing game-based learning in process design teaching might be an alternative way to improve the teaching and learning experience. A demolition game was purposely developed to incorporate the complexity of process design principles and utilized as a class activity. The students' results as well as their comments on the game strategies were documented and studied. This paper investigates the implementation of the game-based approach in a process design course, and discusses and offers conclusions on the effectiveness of a game-based approach in teaching process design.

While increasing and innovative use of interactive digital technologies has been a hallmark of recent changes to higher education practice, the integration of traditional and innovative digital techniques in learning and teaching design and practice remains a crucial issue for university educators. There has been a tendency for new technologies to be added to existing curriculum design and learning and teaching practice in an ad hoc, isolated manner, rather than as part of an overarching learning design which incorporates both new technologies and traditional techniques and understanding of pedagogic principles and practice. Through the integration of the RASE (Resources/Activity/Support /Evaluation) pedagogic student-centred learning model, interactivity and applications of technology, this paper seeks to help teachers design more effective courses to enable students to acquire greater autonomy, and to cultivate dispositions to understand.

The attempts aim at providing the entry level engineers with the skills needed to address the challenges of future large-scale complex systems and projects. Some of the frontier sectors and future challenges for engineers are outlined. The major characteristics of the coming intelligence convergence era (the post-information age) are identified. These include the prevalence of smart devices and environments, the widespread applications of anticipatory computing and predictive / prescriptive analytics, as well as a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines. Devices and machines will be able to learn from, and with, humans in a natural collaborative way. The recent game changers in learnscapes (learning paradigms, technologies, platforms, spaces, and environments) that can significantly impact engineering education in the coming era are identified. Among these are open educational resources, knowledge-rich classrooms, immersive interactive 3D learning, augmented reality, reverse instruction / flipped classroom, gamification, robots in the classroom, and adaptive personalized learning. Significant transformative changes in, and mass customization of, learning are envisioned to emerge from the synergistic combination of the game changers and other technologies. The realization of the aforementioned vision requires the development of a new multidisciplinary framework of emergent engineering for relating innovation, complexity and cybernetics, within the future learning environments. The framework can be used to treat engineering education as a complex adaptive system, with dynamically interacting and communicating components (instructors, individual, small, and large groups of learners). The emergent behavior resulting from the interactions can produce progressively better, and continuously improving, learning environment. As a first step towards the realization of the vision, intelligent adaptive cyber-physical ecosystems need to be developed to facilitate collaboration between the various stakeholders of engineering education, and to accelerate the development of a skilled engineering workforce. The major components of the ecosystems include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities, blended learning and research spaces, novel ultra- intelligent software agents, multimodal and autonomous interfaces, and networked cognitive and tele-presence robots.

Some teachers and educatorsare putting an effort to convert their courses and programs to blended learning for a myriad of reasons such as to increase the number of student enrollment (Dziuban, Hartman, Juge, Moskal, & Sorg, 2006), and to provide an effective way to communicate with students (Borup, Graham, & Velasquez, 2006). Nevertheless, this is usually easier said than done because successful blended learning does not happen automatically. Successful blended learning requires more than the mere use of technology. Successful blended learning requires a careful consideration of the pedagogy and instructional design associated with how best to utilize the technology tools, how to facilitate the interaction among students, how to motivate students to participate in the discussions, as well as what contents are best delivered through the Internet versus face-to-face (Dziuban et al., 2006). Our Master of Arts (Instructional Design & Technology) program was launched in 1999. In this paper, we will share our experience of converting a face-to-face course in the MA program to a blended learning course. The original course wasa 13 weeks one (39 hours of face-to-face instruction). Now it is a two and a half days course (20 hours face-to-face tutorials and 19 hours eLearning activities). We went through the journey from a 13-weeks course to a 4 full-days blended course, subsequently to a 3 full-day, and then finally a 2-and-ahalf-day course. We will share the major reasons to change the face-to-face course into a blended learning course, the essential guidelines to convert face-to-face activities to eLearning activities, the evaluation of the blended learning approach from the instructor's as well as the graduate students'perspectives. In addition, we will share the important lessons learned(challenges and issues) that faculty will encounter in converting face-to-face courses into blended courses",blended-learning approach;elearning,blended learning;blended-learning approach;face-to-face instruction;graduate students;hardware and software;instructional designs;student enrollments;e-learning;government data processing;students;teaching;engineering education,"Anderson, L., Krathwohl, D., (2001) A taxonomy of learning, teaching and assessing: A revision of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, , New York: Addison Wesley Longman; Borup, J., Graham, C.R., Velasquez, A., The use of asynchronous video communication to improve instructor immediacy and social presence in a blended learning environment.

Blended learning is a potentially useful approach to promote collaborative and cooperative learning. It provides opportunities for students to exchange ideas and construct their own knowledge through asynchronous learning tasks. The challenge that tutors commonly encounter is how to motivate students to respond online and to be actively engaged in the learning tasks. In this article, we provide examples of learning activities and describe the critical role that students' narratives play in a blended learning environment. Through a qualitative analysis of the students' narratives of experiences, several themes are generated that inform us on the outcome of narrative inquiry in a blended learning environment.

Research and experiments aim to reconsider current teaching practices for students majoring in European studies. We recognise the need for more flexible teaching strategies, given that the traditional didactic approach to French for specific purposes in Bulgarian universities focuses on acquiring vocabulary through reading comprehension. Therefore, we propose the implementation of an action-oriented approach within blended-learning methodologies.

Delivery of under-graduate degrees, such as those offered in the Yacht Engineering Programme at SSU, are moving increasingly towards a more flexible and student-centred approach, with work in the ""Blended Learning"" technique and On-Line Learning Unit Design finding real potential at this level. Students are now entering university with an expectation that many of the technologies and communication mediums available to them in everyday life will be fully available within the H.E environment. This paper addresses the work being carried out as part of a personal research programme by the Author in completing a higher degree award Master of Professional Development (M Prof), firstly summarising early findings then identifying on-going challenges in completing the work. SSU has a supportive stance in assisting lecturing staff working in this way as part of the C.P.D programme in place within the Maritime and Technology Faculty (MARTEC) in this instance. The paper illustrates some of the techniques developed and is intended primarily to act as a point of reference for the associated conference presentation.

The commonality between metacognition and the community of inquiry is the interplay between internal knowledge construction and collaborative learning activities. In this regard, the CoI framework provides a model of cognition that operationalizes inquiry with the potential to contextualize and understand metacognition in an online learning environment. The metacognitive construct developed using the CoI framework as a theoretical lens is introduced, and the strategies and activities to support metacognition in a community of inquiry are provided.

This development is accompanied by a rapidly increasing complexity of the software environments used with such devices. Therefore a qualified and solid teaching methodology is necessary, accompanied by industry driven technological innovation with an emphasis on programming. As part of three European projects regarding lifelonglearning a comprehensive blended learning concept for teaching embedded systems and robotics was developed by paper authors. It comprises basic exercises in micro controller programming up to high-level student robotic challenges. These implemented measures are supported by a distance learning environment. The programming of embedded systems and microcontroller technology has to be seen as the precursor for more complex robotic systems in this context, but with a high importance for later successfully working with the technology for further professional utilization with these technologies. Current paper introduces the most novel part; the online accessible Virtual Micro Controller Platform (VMCU) and its underlying simulation framework platform. This approach conquers the major existing problems in engineering education: outdated hardware and limited lab times.

Rather than simulating traditional face-to-face classroom methods in online learning environments, the chapter examines different approaches for instructors in creating new ways to link technology to curriculum. This chapter begins by introducing the readers to many of the challenges, concepts, and practices associated with synchronous online learning environments. Through multiple case studies, the chapter will explore the importance of (a) content, pedagogy, and culture, (b) the role of the instructor and student in creating successful online learning environments, and (c) strengths and weaknesses of communication tools and educational technology in creating a blended online learning environment. The chapter helps instructors and students identify the benefits and shortcomings of technology, explore how to enhance dynamic interactions between individuals and groups, and examine how to capitalize on the strengths of audio and visual images to accompany other formats of instructional materials.

Increasingly, emphasis is being placed on the design of new learning spaces, often referred to as ""Next Generation Learning Spaces"" (NGLS) and their impact on pedagogy. The traditional idea of ""classroom"" now incorporates the use of both physical and virtual space. Increasing availability of digital technologies has enabled access by teachers and students to a wider range of communication and information that can now be incorporated into the formal learning process. This change has meant a greater focus on the design and use of flexible learning spaces, more use of blended learning approaches and more personalised, individualised learning opportunities for students. While many such classrooms have been built and used in universities globally, only a few formal studies have been reported on how these spaces are used by both teachers and students. This article focuses on a pilot study of the use by academic staff and students of a next generation learning space - the Pod Room - and makes recommendations for further research into the effectiveness of new learning spaces in universities.

Experience of the pilot workshop suggested a need for more orientation, potentially by introducing a blended learning design. The second iteration highlighted a need to develop the orientation session further and increase support strategies throughout the workshop, suggesting the value of offering it at faculty or department level if no ""reward"" is available for participation. Outcomes from the two cycles illustrate the value of action research for iterative improvement of this staff development model and for implementing the scholarship of teaching and learning to develop and share professional knowledge in this emerging area.

In the past, much of the efforts to bring in reforms have proved to be counter productive. There is so much of wastage of talent and resources that one is compelled to think whether the agile practices that have met with so much of success in manufacturing and in software industry can be of any help in education sector as well. With this guided inquiry we carried out an experiment to practice few of these principles and the results are very encouraging. In this paper we discuss the motivation behind applying agile practices in higher education and the methodology adopted by us with the help of a case study.

The methodology used is a qualitative analysis of interviews with seven tutors of three different blended learning courses. The results show that most tutors indeed had difficulties gaining a deeper insight into the course design: they considered the face-to-face modality to be the central one, just as in a traditional L2 course (whereas course design was centred on the online modality), and therefore rarely played their role as online tutors. Moreover, their understanding of the courses' task-based approach appeared to be limited. Nevertheless, the majority of the tutors managed to feel involved in the course, which shows the importance of additional factors in defining their relationship to the course. We identified eight other factors, which are partly due to the intense use of ICT within the course (as shown by a comparison with two additional interviews with e-learning-tutors), and partly depend specifically on the blended learning mode. This study furthers our understanding of difficulties tutors can have and what support they require within blended language learning settings, although further research will be needed in order to permit greater generalisation.

The author -she is a tutor of this subject -propagates modern teaching methods, especially the use of e-learning in foreign language teaching. But in this article she speaks about the ways in which reading as a classical method of teaching, supplemented by some distinctive components might come into its own also in blended learning process.

Having already evaluated the system for its theoretical validity, it seems pertinent to examine it from a social standpoint. The teachers' perceptions studied deal with language acquisition, teacher roles, students' intellectual capacity and investment, using computer technology for learning and the learning system itself. We will present our theoretical framework, the methodology followed as well as the results and discuss how teachers' perceptions contribute to their acceptance or refusal of the learning system.

But the assumptions built into the discipline and institutional organizational systems for managing study times and staff workload planning can block innovation. Several previous projects have established that intensive team workshops over 2-3 days, involving support staff working with academics to produce real outputs, can build sustainable capacity for curriculum innovation within academic units. This paper describes current work in one university that makes use of disciplinary curriculum mapping and explicit planning of academic and student workload in the educational design activity. Two pilots in different disciplines are being used to develop a model that can be applied and contextualized as part of a broader sustainable blended learning strategy.

The space of tension between the three top-down drivers from outside and within the walls of a regional Northern Australian university had to be managed and prioritised to ensure the needs of local stakeholders were met as far as economically and practicably possible. By going beyond blended learning the aim is to provide a deeper level of engagement and collaboration to create synergies designed to bring the distant external students into the classroom. This will be mediated by the use of web-conferencing within the teaching spaces. The change process is examined with respect to five issues identified as relevant for this teaching mode to improve the sustainability of our teaching practices.

What remains an open question, though, is to what extent the availability of ecurricula bears on students' disciplined class attendance. In Hungary students are not required to attend a lecture course (as opposed to seminars and practices); therefore, ecurricula may increase the number of classes in whose case student attendance has never been characteristic in the first place. The only way to avoid the situation getting worse is to assign the e-curriculum a role in which it represents only part of the knowledge to be acquired.

Students do not see e-Learning as replacing traditional instructor-led training but as a complement to it, forming part of a blended-learning strategy. Innovations in e-Learning technologies point toward a revolution in education, allowing learning to be individualized (adaptive learning), enhancing learners' interactions with others (collaborative learning), and transforming the role of the teacher. The integration of e-Learning into medical education can catalyze the shift towards applying adult learning theory, where educators will no longer serve mainly as the distributors of content, but will become more involved as facilitators of learning and assessors of competency. This survey analyzes possibilities to effectively use e-Learning in medical education, and what steps are to be made in that direction.

There is also much quest for learning in an environment that provides equal opportunities to all learners. The need to provide an equal opportunity learning environment that will hitherto improve the system of education globally has therefore become imperative. Based on our findings, a mathematical model Web-based Virtual Classroom system (WebVCS) was developed to provide a viable medium through which sound education can be offered in tertiary institutions that can carter for varieties of learners irrespective of their abilities, dispositions and geographical locations. Our system model is developed based on active learning approach that adopts blended learning theory (Constructivist-Cognivist learning approach), incorporating e-pedagogy that supports collaboration among participants in the web-based Virtual learning environment. The key objects used in creating the WebVCS model are: Courses, Students, Instructors and Learning performances. Our system model sets a framework for developers of virtual classrooms and successful implementation of the model leads to students learning by interacting with their peers resulting in the construction of knowledge",,,"Adewale, O.S., University Digital Libraries: Adaptive (2007) Personalised E-Learning System, , Yerimah Prints, Nigeria; Atasi, M., Madanmohan, S., (2008), http://www.aiaer.net/ejournal/Vol19207/24.Atasi_Madan.htm, Learning Through Virtual Classroom; Bernie, D., (2008) Some Thoughts About WebQuests, , http://edweb.sdsu.edu/courses/edtec596/about_webquests.html.on, December 22, 2008; Carina, A., Rune, P., Design of a Virtual Classroom (2002) A paper presented at the 34th Annual onference of the International Visual Literacy association, , Breckenridge, Colorado, U.S.A, October 1 - 5; Elizabeth, N., Jason, G., Jeremy, S., Beginning PHP5 (2005) Apache and MySQL WebDevelopment, , Wiley Publishing Inc, U.S.A; Paratone, J.R., McCormack, R.L., (1997) Peer Talk in the Classroom: Learning from Research, , .(eds.)

Peer creation may help to address this challenge. However, existing concepts of peer learning focus mostly on enhancing active discussion and reflection. Thus far, little to no research has addressed processes of systematically creating modular, re-usable learning materials and evaluated the extent to which these materials can enrich the learning experience. To close this gap, we transferred principles of traditional peer learning onto the creation of self-contained, high quality eLearning materials: Web Based Trainings that served as an interactive script and multiple-choice tests as peer assessments. These learning materials were used in a large-scale Information Systems course1. We analyzed user logs, measured learning outcomes by a pre- and post-power-test (n = 164) and evaluated learner satisfaction by an online questionnaire (n = 128). Results show a significant correlation between usage of the peer created eLearning materials and learning outcomes, as well as satisfaction. The study contributes to the pedagogical research by adapting and evaluating traditional peer learning concepts onto eLearning content creation. To practitioners, it reveals ways of creating high quality eLearning materials in spite of limited resources",blended learning;elearning;peer assessment;peer creation;peer learning;web based training,e-learning;teaching;blended learning;peer assessment;peer creation;peer learning;web based training;information systems,"Alavi, M., Marakas, G., Yoo, Y., A comparative study of distributed learning environments on learning outcomes (2002) Information Systems Research, 13 (4), pp. 404-415; Auvinen, A.M., The challenge of quality in peer-produced eLearning content (2009) ELearning Papers, , http://www.elearningeuropa.info/files/media/media21212.pdf; Blohm, I., Bretschneider, U., Leimeister, J.M., Krcmar, H., Does collaboration among participants lead to better ideas in IT-based idea competitions?

In order to enable them to educate themselves at the time and place they prefer, we designed an electronic EBM course. We studied the feasibility and utility of the course as well as its effectiveness in increasing EBM knowledge, skills, and behaviour. Methods: Occupational physicians from various countries were included in a within-subjects study. Measurements were conducted on participants' EBM knowledge, skills, behaviour, and determinants of behaviour at baseline, directly after finishing the course and 2 months later (n = 36). The feasibility and utility of the course were evaluated directly after the course (n = 42). Results: The course is applicable as an introductory course on EBM for occupational physicians in various countries. The course is effective in enhancing EBM knowledge and self-efficacy in practising EBM. No significant effect was found on EBM skills, behaviour, and determinants of behaviour. After the course, more occupational physicians use the international journals to solve a case. Conclusion: An electronic introductory EBM course is suitable for occupational physicians. Although it is an effective method for increasing EBM knowledge, it does not seem effective in improving skills and behaviour. We recommend integrating e-learning courses with blended learning, where it can be used side by side with other educational methods that are effective in changing behaviour.

Yet new media and technological advances are opening up exciting and innovative ways of exploring collaborative teaching and learning environments which are not only necessary and beneficial to the creation of programmes delivered at a distance, but also pay dividends when applied to on-site teaching scenarios, particularly in a blended learning environment. If ‘Shakespeare’ really operates as a global brand in the ways that so many critics and scholars have asserted, then it would appear that he represents the perfect vehicle through which to capitalise on these possibilities (Lanier, 2007: 93–113; Hodgdon, 1998). Erin Sullivan in this volume observes that too much can be made of the distinction between distance and face-to-face learners and that learning outcomes rather than digital tools should be the drivers of course design (above 66). There is wisdom in this view, but there is also value in asking what the distance-learning opportunity, especially when focused around a global brand such as Shakespeare, might afford us in terms of innovative teaching and learning experiences that might themselves help to create and foster the kind of international learning community that we have as our cohort at the University of Nottingham. The field of Shakespeare adaptation studies is particularly pertinent in this respect; not only is Shakespeare remade and re-imagined in a range of genres and media (full-length and short film, video, graphic novel, song, video game, novel, poetry, prose) but he is also reshaped in a variety of cultural and geographical contexts. As Sonia Massai observes, ‘the field of Shakespeare Studies has been radically transformed by the emergence of significant world-wide localities, within which Shakespeare is made to signify anew’ (2005a: 8).

In this framework, the European Commission promotes the TEMPUS - Trans European Mobility Programme for University Studies [1]. Curricula harmonization and lifelong learning programme development in higher education are among the focused aspects of the TEMPUS programme [2]. The DEREL - Development of Environment and Resources Engineering Learning, is a three years TEMPUS project coordinated by the University of Firenze, in cooperation with colleagues of the Ss Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje financed and activated since October 2010. The DER-EL Project Consortium consists of 4 EU Universities (from Italy, Greece, Germany and Austria), 7 Partner Countries (PC) Universities (from FYR of Macedonia, Serbia and Albania), 1 PC Ministry, 4 PC National Agencies, 1 PC non governmental organization and 1 PC enterprise. The DEREL project is aimed to introduce a new, up-to-date, postgraduate second level curriculum in Environment and Resources Engineering at the Ss Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje (CMU), FYR of Macedonia, University of Novi Sad (UNS), Serbia and Polytechnic University of Tirana (PUT), Albania, based on the European Credit Transfer System and in accordance with the Bologna Process, following the criteria and conditions for setting up a Joint Postgraduate Degree. A second objective is to implement a sustainable regional network aimed to offer lifelong learning seminars for environment and resources engineering education and training of interested stakeholders and organize workshops focused on strengthening the links in the knowledge triangle: environment education-innovation-research, with participation of postgraduate students, public services, enterprises and NGO's. The curricula and lifelong learning courses development includes surveys of educational & labour market needs at the PC, organization of academic visits from PC to EU Universities, PC staff training and retraining, preparation and publication of educational materials and promotion documents, as well as project dissemination activities. Despite the very ambitious goals of the project proposal, all activities foreseen for the first 18 months were realized or are at a very advanced stage. The new postgraduate studies in Environment and Resources Engineering at CMU, UNS and PUT will start in September 2012 and they will include web-based and blended learning courses. Also, the good collaborative environment created, since 2005, with the project partners can be surely mentioned as an additional value of the project, enabling implementation of a sustainable regional network [3]",distance learning;e-learning;presence learning,curricula;distance education;e-learning;education;employment;personnel training;social networking (online);societies and institutions;sustainable development;collaborative environments;education and training;educational materials;environment educations;european credit transfer systems;nongovernmental organizations;postgraduate students;presence learning;engineering education,"McCabe, R., Ruffio, P., Heinamaki, P., TEMPUS @ 20 - A retrospective of the TEMPUS programme over the past twenty years (1990) Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union, , 2010, © European Union; European Commission, (2010) The EU Contribution to the European Higher Education Area, , Luxembourg: Publication Office of the European union; Reilly, J., Jongsma, A., (2011) Regional Seminars on University Governance in the TEMPUS Partner Countries (2010-2011), (8). , Conclusions, - October 2011; Caporali, E., Tuneski, A., Trajkovik, V., Palmisano, E., Valdiserri, J., Enhancing environmental engineering education in eastern Europe (2011) Proc. of the SEFI Annual Conference: Global Engineering Recognition, Sustainability, Mobility, Lisbon, Portugal, p. 659. , Editors: Jorge Bernardino and Jose Carlos Quadrado, 665 CD 124; Council of Europe, (2009) European Convention on Human Rights: As Amended by Protocols Nos. 11 and 14.

Traditional educational monitoring is based on pre-course and post-course surveys and often measures students' subjective view of the learning environment. As we know, extrinsic motivational elements often have a greater impact on students' opinion of teaching quality than do didactical principles. We therefore define the quality of a course by the amount of knowledge our students have acquired. In consequence, we prefer to use performance data as the basis for learning evaluation. In this paper we present performance data from 284 students which is stored in an educational data warehouse (eDWH). This data has been linked to process data and status data from the same students. Our findings indicate that performance data can be useful in operationalising the quality of a blended learning environment. Based on three concrete examples, we have been able to illustrate the potential of educational monitoring based on performance data. Our monitoring concept not only allows us to verify the validity of our examinations, but also serves to improve our course and to measure this improvement. The results presented here therefore show that the monitoring of a blended learning environment can indeed be improved using performance data.

The main aim is to analyse the three different components of this ""blended learning"" pedagogical approach, as well as the way they complement each other and to address a few of the challenges that have emerged from the experience of working with them so far. The E-modules are an e-learning platform that has been designed with the purpose of offering a structured and interactive way of learning how the European Union functions. The face-to-face training component currently takes the form of three days in-house seminars, covering in an intensive manner the most important areas of the curriculum. The lectures are held by a mix of academics and practitioners, hereby ensuring a balanced approach, in which theory and practice come together to facilitate the learning experience. The third element of the ""blended learning"" method is placed in-between online and face-toface learning: interactive seminars and debates are held online, giving the participants the chance to deepen their knowledge in certain fields of interest and to discuss the content of the course with specialists and among themselves. The mixture of delivery and interaction methods was chosen in order to accommodate a large variety of target groups, ranging from students to professionals working with EUrelated issues, with different backgrounds and geographical origins. One of the main challenges is to use each medium for the functionalities it is best designed for and to ensure that the various pieces of the pedagogical puzzle fit together perfectly, while allowing the learners the flexibility that had initially directed them towards ""blended learning"" instead of a classical classroom approach",blended learning;e-learning;european studies;social sciences;webinars,blended learning;brussels;e-learning platforms;e-learning tool;european studies;european union;geographical origins;interaction methods;interactive way;learning experiences;pedagogical approach;target group;teaching methods;theory and practice;training sessions;webinars;curricula;e-learning;social sciences;teaching,"Procter, C., (2003) Blended Learning in Practice, , Inaugural Education in a Changing Environment conference University of Salford, Salford, UK; Mihai, A., Teaching European Studies Online: The Challenge of Quality Assurance (2009) European Journal of Open, Distance and E-learning, , http://www.eurodl.org/?article=377, [online]; Singh, H., Building Effective Blended Learning Programs (2003) Educational Technology, 43 (6), pp. 51-54; Heinze, A., Procter, C., Reflections on the use of blended learning (2004) Education in a Changing Environment, , 13-14 September 2004, University of Salford, UK; Garrison, R., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) Internet and Higher Education, 7, pp. 95-105. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iheduc.2004.02.001; Budka, P., Mader, E., (2006) E-learning in the social sciences: experiences with creating communities, networks and strategies, , paper read at the conference Learning Communities, Klagenfurt, Austria 9-11 November 2006; Oliver, M., Trigwell, K., Can 'Blended Learning' Be Redeemed?

From theoretical considerations about the instrumental genesis of the artifact and the appropriation of resources, we try to characterize appropriation processes through a threshold which means that appropriation is done without misappropriating the design goal of resources and scenario. This study focuses on a French national blended learning program (Pairformence) based on a collaborative training. More specifically, we tend to highlight modifications, additions and suppressions of resources as well as modifications of scenario and use of supports as indicators of appropriation. These indicators are proposed from the analysis of four interviews with trainers and then verified by reading logbook of other trainers. Results from the analysis lead us to propose a collaborative tool for improving asynchronous interaction between designer and teacher.

A frequently observed problem is that the learners become overtaxed during independent learning in virtual learning phases because they are not provided with the necessary support. For this reason, there is a great need for qualified instructors, so-called e-tutors, who are trained in the specific factors and requirements associated with virtual learning environments. Since 2005, Ludwig-Maximilian-University in Munich offers courses for the professional education of e-tutors through the Virtual University of Bavaria (VHB). The goal of this training is to meet the growing need for tutors to assist learners in the ever-increasing world of e-learning for advanced education courses at universities. In order to ensure that learning is practical and applicable, the training is designed as a blended learning course according to problem-oriented learning (Reinmann & Mandl, 2006) including a web-based training with self-directed and cooperative learning phases. The aim of this paper is to provide clarity about the quality and effectiveness of the training as well as evidence of the robustness and the success of the course concept over several iterations. The analysis focuses on aspects of the quality of the learning environment, acceptance and learning success. Overall, the course concept proved itself successful over various course iterations.

Compared with traditional classroom training, e-learning gives increased flexibility in terms of time and place, permitting a reduction of direct and indirect training costs and the optimization of time spent on training. The possibility to personalize training courses lends itself to the fulfilment of learning objectives for a wide range of professional needs in large companies and organizations. Finally, an adequate involvement of company employees in the design, implementation, delivery and assessment phases of e-learning courses represents an opportunity for improvement and development of human resources within the organization itself. With these considerations in mind, the Italian Revenue Agency has chosen to include e-learning in its training programme by implementing a pilot project.

As part of this move, many universities have pursued the development of a managed learning environment with efficient interfaces between web-based learning materials and learner support materials (Beck, Livne and Bear 2005; Liu and Tsai 2005). The teaching and learning strategy at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), for instance, emphasises the wider use of blended learning, and the provision of facilities for learners to 'develop ... personal responsibility, and commitment to being independent learners', and to enhance their 'ownership of goal planning and continuous review' through ePortfolio technology and methods (Hong Kong Polytechnic University 2008, 11-3). In the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands and Australia, ePortfolios serve a variety of purposes and audiences, and are implemented using diverse software tools in a range of educational and professional contexts. The European Language Portfolio (ELP) is an example of the ePortfolio as a tool to allow for self-, teacher and institutional assessment of a learner's proficiency in languages (Council of Europe 2008). Research findings (Little 2004) confirm the value of the ELP in raising learner awareness of the language learning process, and in supporting the development of a learner's ability to self-evaluate. Other studies (e.g. Woodward and Nanlohy 2004), however, highlight concern about ePortfolio practice being widely viewed as an episodic endeavour rather than an activity of lasting usefulness. Hong Kong is in its infancy in terms of ePortfolio practice and research, particularly in the domain of independent language learning. One possible reason is that many teachers in Hong Kong doubt that Chinese students, being commonly perceived as teacher-reliant (Bond 1996; Farmer and Sweeney 1997), are capable of assuming the more active learner role required of them in ePortfolio use. This chapter discusses how sustained ePortfolio practice can provide a robust basis for fostering independent language learning in higher education. The suggestion of a link between ePortfolio pedagogy and notions of independent language learning draws support from research findings (Abrami and Barrett 2005; Joyes, Gray and Hartnell- Young 2010), citing the former as a resource that allows learners to construct knowledge, refine their understanding, and learn socially through interacting with peers and teachers. As Abrami and Barrett (2005) point out, ePortfolios: Encourage learners to explore topics from a personal perspective capitalizing on and potentially increasing intrinsic interest. Intrinsic interest and the involvement in authentic learning tasks may also lead to [an] increased ... sense of personal commitment and ownership. It is noteworthy that attributes such as ownership and commitment are closely associated with independent learning (Sheerin 1991), selfdirected learning (Candy 1991), and learner awareness (van Lier 1996)- Terms which tend to overlap in the literature on autonomy. Added to this is recent interest in linking autonomy to other student-focused constructs such as self-motivation, agency and identity, rendering the boundaries of autonomy as a field increasingly permeable (Benson 2006). The use of the term 'autonomy' in this article is drawn from the work of Little (1995, 175), who argues that an autonomous learner: Accepts responsibility for his or her learning. This acceptance of responsibility has both socio- Affective and cognitive implications ... [involving] a positive attitude to learning and the development of a capacity to reflect on the content and process of learning with a view to bringing them...under conscious control. Little's perspective on autonomy is congruent with that of a socioconstructivist view of learning, where co-construction of knowledge and social interaction in the learning process constitute its central concern. ePortfolio practice that aims to cultivate independent learning will provide opportunities and support facilities for promoting learner responsibility for aspects of the language learning process. The learner is conceptualised as a socially constituted agent. The primary objective of this chapter is to report the findings of three ePortfolio research studies at the PolyU aimed at informing the design of an ePortfolio to help university learners develop their English language skills. An analysis of the findings in terms of learners' ability to foster longterm ePortfolio use and engage in independent language learning is included. Insights derived from the analysis offer a useful base from which to consider four principles that might guide the development of similar independent language learning ePortfolios. The generic nature of these four principles permits their applicability across diverse settings and learners. This chapter comprises four main sections. The context for which the ePortfolio was developed and key research methods are presented first. This is followed by a discussion of the principles of ePortfolio design for sustained ePortfolio practice and independent language learning from two perspectives: Theory and practice. The chapter concludes by examining the potential contribution of these principles to our understanding of long- Term ePortfolio practice, and how this can support independent learning.

This paper presents an extract of a study conducted among AAUK students and lecturers during three different semester terms analyzing the status quo (N = 1154). Results reveal that quality issues are strongly attributable to flexibility, more efficient use of resources, collaboration and cooperation as well as receiving more feedback. Additionally, blended learning can contribute essentially to the re-academization initiative inter alia through self-responsibility and efficient online (self-) testing applications.

As a result, few studies have explored the potential to effectively connect these two forms of learning. Nevertheless, in practice, a well-thought-out linkage between these different approaches is essential to leverage and facilitate the learning process. Thus, in this paper, we propose an ontological model that captures the similarity between the two forms of learning, with a focus on participants' interactions. One of the benefits of this model is the creation of a flexible framework to describe learning independently of the approach used to learn. Second, it also enables us to describe the design rationale of learning scenarios and to organize theoretical knowledge for designing such scenarios in the same manner. To validate this model, we show its advantages with the examination in modeling theories for didactic and collaborative learning, and describe the development of an authoring tool for learning design that uses the model to facilitate the design of theory-based blended learning scenarios.

To achieve this aim, students, primarily from health and ICT related fields have been recruited to become 'trainers/teachers'.

Passive involvement of students in their learning process generally leads to a limited retention of knowledge.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper deconstructs the evolving components of blended learning in order to identify changes induced by digital technologies for enhancing teaching and learning environments. Findings: This paper hypothesizes that blended learning may be traced back to early medieval times when printed material provided the first asynchronous learning opportunities. However, the digitalization of contemporary learning environments results in a de-emphasis on teaching and learning spaces. When time becomes the primary organizing construct for education in a technology-supported environment, blending possibilities emerge around five components: migration, support, location, learner empowerment, and flow. Research limitations/implications: This study enables the readers to conceptualize blended learning as a combination of modern media, communication modes, times and places in a new kind of learning synthesis in place of traditional classrooms and technology with the teacher serving as a facilitator of a collective learning process. Practical implications: The major implication of this paper is that modern learning technologies have freed students and educators from the lock in of classroom space as being the primary component of blended learning, thereby emphasizing learning rather than teaching in the planning process. Originality/value: This paper proposes a new model of blended learning in which physical teaching environments give way to time. Time and synchronicity become the primary elements of the learning environments. In addition, the authors suggest that the time-based model as an educational ""new normal"" results in technologies as enablers rather than disruptors of learning continuity.

The global prominence of this emerging trend is the result of the technological revolution that offered new possibilities of interactivity. The integration of e-learning as a complement rather than a substitute for traditional learning created the hybrid approach to learning called Blended learning. This paper attempts to measure the students' satisfaction they receive from their studies at The Arab Open University - Kuwait Branch within a blended system. Student satisfaction is reliant on factors such as the academic support provided by the tutors, teaching materials, teaching pedagogy, the range of the academic subjects taught, the IT infrastructure, the curriculum, e-library and the different assessment provided by the institution. The aim of this paper is three-fold: first, to measure student satisfaction by developing an appropriate questionnaire that covers most of the sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction areas; second, to identify the constructs that are critical to a satisfying blended learning experience; and finally, to provide a feedback to the AOU officials on the effect of environmental factors to be used as a guide for further extension of regional branches in some other Arabic countries. To achieve these goals, a questionnaire was conducted containing fourteen items. Students responded from different programs and different courses (n=165).Data Analysis showed that AOU- Kuwait Branch enjoys a high rate of student satisfaction.

We have produced didactic videos for teaching pathology in a clinical context in addition to regular lectures at the university. Didactic material includes macroscopic and histological findings, as well as cartoons explaining pathophysiology and clinical links.Videos can be downloaded in mv4 format as podcasts to a local hard disk or to an iPhone or iPod via iTunes University and are designed to improve classical medical literature. Analysis over 3 years of server traffic and subjective impressions by the students revealed regular use and high acceptance by users.Didactic material in clinical pathology can be successfully integrated in videos to complement lectures and practical training.

Because welding is embedded into more and more complex processes, education in welding must also include interdisciplinary subjects. These include material testing and corrosion protection. The training and further education of designers in the field of welding technology also needs to be given special attention. In addition, modern education presupposes a close relation to the general state of the art of science and technology. To this end, the network of the International Institute of Welding and, in particular, the elevated competences of university research institutes offer the best opportunities. In September 2010, at the first international conference Welding Trainer 2010 - The Future of Education, the virtual welding training industry met in Duisburg, Germany. The international conference was supported by most of the experienced developers and users of virtual welding trainer systems from the United States, Canada, France, Spain, Austria, and Germany. It offered a large forum with more than 80 participants from 5 continents and 25 countries to discuss new and innovative teaching methods. The final decision of the parties involved was to go ahead with their development of virtual welding systems and to repeat the event on a biannual schedule",,austria;blended learning;complex processes;distance learning course;final decision;further education;germany;innovative teaching;international institute of welding;latest development;material testing;science and technology;skills training;state of the art;training devices;university research;virtual welding system;welding technology;welding training;engineering education;welding;e-learning,,Weld J,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856480398,2,0.5,Germany,Germany,german welding institute,german welding institute,addition;art;attention;austria;biannual schedule;canada;close relation;competences;competencies;complex process;conference;conference welding;continent;continents;corrosion;corrosion protection;countries;country;courses;decision;designers;developers;development;device;device virtual;discuss;distance;distance learning;duisburg;education;education competency;education presupposes;end;event;field;final decision;forum;france;future;general state;germany;gsi;include;industry;innovative teaching;institute;institute offer;institutes;interdisciplinary subject;international conference;international institute;large forum;material;met;methods;modern education;needs;network;newer;offer;opportunities;participant;participants;parties;presupposes;processes;protection;relation;repeat;research;research institute;schedule;science;september;spain;special attention;state;states;subjects;systems;technology;trainer;trainer system;training;training device;training industry;united state;university;university research;users;virtual welding,developments;skill training;skills;training;welding skill,456

The strengths and the weaknesses of BL are emphasized by analyzing students' projects and their learning outcomes. The following lessons for improving the BL process emerged along the study: online resources with addictive potential can be used to strengthen efficient learning; the facilitators need to re-adapt the previously designed forums so these better meet the actual needs; the role of the instructor is decisive for a good blend; students' projects offer good conditions for learning by doing. ,blended learning;competence;expertise;online interactions;portfolio,blended learning;competence;expertise;online interaction;portfolio;online systems;personnel training;teaching;information technology,"Dohn, N., Implicit educational demands on learners (2009) Electronic Journal of E-learning, 7 (2), pp. 111-118. , Web 2.0-Mediated Competence; Homer-Dixon, T., (2000) The Ingenuity Gap: Facing the Economic, Environmental, and Other Challenges of an Increasingly Complex and Unpredictable World, , New York: Knopf; Means, B., Evaluation of evidence-based practices in online learning (2009) A Meta-analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies, , U.S. Department of Education, Center for Technology in Learning; Reeves, R., Alternative approaches for online learning environments in higher education (2000) Journal of Educational Computing Research, 23 (1), pp. 101-111; Sarivan, L., Singer, F.M., New media for better teachers - The story of masterprof (2010) UPG Bulletin, Educational Series, 62 (1 A), pp. 153-161. , (2010); Singer, F.M., Sarivan, L., (2006) Quo Vadis, Academia?, , Sigma, Bucharest; Singer, F.M., The dynamic infrastructure of mind - A hypothesis and some of its applications (2009) New Ideas in Psychology, 27, pp. 48-74; Singer, F.M., Balancing globalisation and local identity in the reform of education in Romania (2006) Internalisation and Globalisation in Mathematics and Science Education, , B.

The programme presented here was designed for several hundred students, all following the same course, but with different needs and abilities. The theoretical framework to this research is task-based, or rather task-supported learning: the programme is a blend of distance learning supported by a virtual learning environment (VLE) and sessions with the teacher. Identifying the steps necessary to enable students and teachers to adopt a task-based learning programme also forms part of the research. The programme, the planning of which started in 2006, has now completed the second year of experimentation and this article will concentrate on its development and evaluation while highlighting some preliminary results",blended learning;evaluation;feedback-driven action;linking face to face and distance learning;personal monitoring;pre-task preparation;task-based learning;tasks;tasksupported learning,,"Alber, J.-L., Py, B., Interlangue et conversation exolingue (1984) Bulletin de la Section de Linguistique de la Faculte des Lettres de Lausanne, (6), pp. 217-234; Bachman, L.F., Palmer, A.S., (1996) Language Testing in Practice, , Oxford : OUP; Bygate, M., Skehan, P., Swain, M., (2001) Researching Pedagogic Tasks Second Language Learning, Teaching and Testing, , Harlow : Pearson Longman; Crosnier, E., LEA/LANSAD Convergences/Divergences (2008) Les Cahiers de L'APLIUT, 27 (1), pp. 18-31; De Singly, F., (2005) L'enquete et Ses Methodes, le Questionnaire, , Paris : Armand Colin; Dornyei, Z., Psychological processes in cooperative language learning: Group dynamics and motivation (1997) Modern Language Journal, (81), pp. 482-493; Dornyei, Z., The motivational basis of language learning tasks (2002) Individual Differences and Instructed Language Learning, pp. 137-158. , ROBINSON, P.

The authors follow the principled task-based curriculum design phases informed by Long and Crookes (1993) and Long and Norris (2000). Unit-based development made the workload manageable and provided an important experimental space for the instructors to best align task-based principles with online language instruction. First, the context of the project and its theoretical TBLT curriculum development framework are established. The distinct processes of needs analysis, materials development, task sequencing and teaching methods, and assessment methods adopted to meet the special requirements of the class are presented, along with a preliminary formative and summative evaluation of the teaching model. The conclusion discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the project.

This project is ongoing and has started to evaluate whether the Nutrition Support 20 credit module was effective in terms of model of delivery, accessibility of study the learner and impact on clinical practice. The module was designed in blended learning format with 4 face to face contact days and a range of online activities and module tutor support through WebCT. The module aimed to consolidate and expand upon the knowledge base of individuals already working in the field of nutrition support and to enhance their eLearning skills making them fit for purpose in the health service of the future. The impact of the module on leaner's knowledge and skills base was evaluated as part of a project to further increase the amount of eLearning within the module in the future. A survey was constructed using ""Surveymonkey"" and distributed by email to all participants of the module. 13 dietitians responded who had undertaken the NS module over the last 2 academic years since the module commenced. All respondents felt the module was worthwhile and general student evaluation of the module including the eLearning components was very positive. Participant expectations were generally positive. Comments included Participants felt they would be more employable in the future, as to stay ahead you need to know what is the latest research and have advanced skills. 70% of participants felt that patient outcomes had been improved as a result of the module. Comments on changes in clinical practice following completion of the module included:-dietitans now feeling more confident covering complex cases as a result of the knowledge component of the module. Clinical reasoning and patient assessment also improved. Ninety two percent of participants commented that they would undertake a further blended learning M-level module. The final phase of the project will use focus groups to investigate learner ideas to reduce the face to face contact and replace with meaningful and effective e-based activities to ensure the same positive learner outcomes around quality of patient care are maintained",blended learning;module;nutrition support;outcomes,e-learning;felt;felts;knowledge based systems;nutrition;blended learning;continuing professional development;e-learning components;knowledge components;module;national health services;outcomes;student evaluation;surveys,"www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/ PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_117353, DOH White Paper (2010) Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS; Lacey, C., Cross, N., A problem based nutrition care model that is diagnostic driven and allows for monitoring and managing outcomes (2002) JAMA, 102 (4), pp. 578-588. , www.bapen.org.uk, NICE 2006.

In order to help the students meet these requirements, a great emphasis should be placed, among others, on their ability to read critically. However, students usually come to university with limited experience in academic reading, which reflects in their failure in academic tasks and at worst, consequent withdrawal from the university. Therefore, the introductory Study Skills course for the first year EFL students was modified so that it offered students an extended exposure to the reading tasks and activities through blended learning. An on-line module that supplemented in-class sessions was designed so that it complied with the principles of scaffolding instruction that helps students, by offering enough support, apply skills and strategies independently. This also aimed to ""facilitate motivational development in reading"" and assured ""that the students are not lost or ill-guided"" (McNamara, 2007). For tutors, this scheme helped intensively assist the students' learning and thus foster comprehension monitoring. The effects of the course were examined and the following research questions were addressed: What are common students' deficiencies in critical reading skills? Does the computer-mediated instruction help students understand more in-depth subject matter? What further adjustments of the course will have to be done? The article presents an insight into the EFL teacher trainees' common reading problems, reports on the effectiveness of the on-line environment as judged by the students, and addresses desirable measures in further research",blended learning;critical reading;reading competence;scaffolding,application programs;e-learning;education;scaffolds;social networking (online);teaching;blended learning;cognitive strategy;comprehension monitoring;critical reading;online environments;reading competence;research questions;scaffolding;students,"Adams, R.W., Patterson, B., (2008) Developing Reading Versatility, , Thomson, Wadsworth, Boston; Alderson, J.C., (2005) Assessing Reading, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Block, E., The Comprehension Strategies of Second Language Readers (1986) TESOL Quarterly, 20 (3), pp. 463-494. , September; Bonk, C.J., Graham, C.R., (2006) The Handbook of Blended Learning.

The application was configured in accordance with the pedagogical needs of every course included in the project. A space restricted to course participants was created, and students of the same subject on several courses and/or years were incorporated, as were the lecturers. Educational networks, as collaborative environments, do not refer to computers, cables, satellites or software. Rather, they describe the participants in a specific educational experience who are connected via an electronic system that facilitates interaction between them. The versatility of educational networks allows various teaching-learning methods to be combined in a single study space. Alongside teaching practices that are more traditional, it is possible to generate contexts that include collaborative and cooperative practices based on horizontality. Finally, the meaning of educational networks is linked to the pedagogical project into which each experience falls. Technology in itself does not innovate; rather, it is the social appropriation of technology - educational in this instance - that leads to change",collaborative environments;networks;social media;teaching,,"(2008) Web 2.0 Technologies for Learning at KS3 and KS4 - Project Overview, , http://partners.becta.org.uk/index.php?section=rh&catcode=_re_rp_02&rid=1454, BECTA (British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) [Accessed: April 2010]; Brunner, J.J., (2003) Educacion e Internet: ¿la Proxima Revolucion?, , Santiago de Chile: Fondo de Cultura Economica; Buckingham, D., (2008) Mas Alla de la Tecnologia, , Buenos Aires: Manantial; Cabero Almenara, J., Las TIC como elementos para la flexibilizacion de los espacios educativos: Retos y preocupaciones (2004) Comunicacion y Pedagogia, (194). , http://tecnologiaedu.us.es/bibliovir/pdf/agosto05.pdf, Spain: Universidad de Sevilla.

The approach is based on the premise that courseware for e-learning should be much more than just a set of online learning materials. In order to identify what e-learning courseware should include and how it should be designed, we consider the task of designing and delivering for e-learning from a broad perspective, taking into account the nature of the learning activity, learner learning styles, and the milieu and media within which the learning community is formed and learning activities take place. A framework for design and delivery for e-learning was developed with an aim to include relevant constituents which are required for learning outcomes to be achieved. The framework covers the entire lifecycle of a taught module from planning to design to delivery, and includes guidelines for: (1) e-learning design process, (2) e-learning design product, and (3) e-learning delivery. It can also be used to evaluate existing courseware for improvement and/or re-design purpose",blended learning;courseware;e-learning;learning design;virtual learning environment,,"Anderson, T., (2008) The Theory and Practice of Online Learning, , 2nd Edition, AU Press, Athabasca University, Canada; Biggs, J., (1999) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , Buckingham.

The assessment literature suggests a number of imperatives that should drive a renewed focus in assessment including; capturing the potential of online assessment, designing efficient and effective assessment, fostering academic honesty, and supporting effective group work. However, there is little guidance in the form of frameworks for the development of online assessment strategies. As a group of instructional designers engaged in a collaborative process of developing assessment strategies with online instructors, we present in-situ qualitative case studies that articulate our design practice in support of the development of online assessments, in line with the imperatives identified above. We discuss a range of assessment strategies and how these have been designed and developed, including professionalism and peer assessment, virtual patients, collaborative writing, and problem solving with extended case studies. We present and discuss the reflections of our co-instructional designers, the instructors, on the impact of these approaches on their teaching practice and the experience of their learners.

During this time I have been immersing myself in the online environment and grappling to figure out what academic blogging means to me. To offer the reader a rich insight into this experience I present a reflective account together with an analysis of these formative experiences of social media. Higher Education (HE) in the Western world is currently grappling to position itself in a shifting landscape of economic rationalisation, too-fast-to-keep-up technological innovation, and escalating marketisation (OLTF 2011). Blended learning and social media are being explored as potential solutions to these pressures. In this paper I explore the potential opportunities and challenges afforded by academic blogging for professional development. The concepts I have used as a framework for discussion are: exposure, engagement and networking. It is argued that these features combined with the non-hierarchical structure of social media (Siemens and Weller 2011) mean that academic blogging has the potential to create a self-organising, highly responsive and digitally reflexive staff, for a relatively low cost. However, not all academics or institutions will be comfortable with the time investment or risk associated with writing in the public domain. However, if institutions refuse to accept blogging as a form of scholarly activity then academics may struggle to position themselves as public intellectuals in the digital age (Kirkup 2010)",academic scholarship;blogging;online identity;professional development;social media,amphibious vehicles;blogs;e-learning;professional aspects;social networking (online);academic scholarship;blogging;online identity;professional development;social media;education,"Davies, J., Merchant, G., Looking from the inside out: academic blogging as new literacy (2007) A new literacies sampler, pp. 119-167. , Lankshear, C and Knobel, M (eds.), New York, Peter Lang; Hayler, M., Autoethnography: making memory methodology (2010) Research in Education (R.Ed), 3 (1), pp. 5-9; Kirkup, G., Academic blogging: academic practice and academic identity (2010) London Review of Education, 8 (1), pp. 75-84; Kjellberg, S., I am a blogging researcher: Motivations for blogging in a scholarly context (2010) First Monday, 15 (8); Mackey, J., Evans, T., Interconnecting networks of practice for professional learning (2011) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 12 (3), pp. 1-18; Mccrea, P., Unconventional approach to a paper about blogging (2011) Learnerosity [Blog], , http://is.gd/Xi4FxU, accessed 01/06/11; (2011) Collaborate to compete: seizing the opportunity of online learning for UK higher education, , http://is.gd/e5Efk7, Online, accessed 06/03/11; Pachler, N., Daly, C., Narrative and learning with Web 2.0 technologies: towards a research agenda (2009) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 25 (1), pp. 6-18; Siemens, G., Weller, M., Higher education and the promises and perils of social networks (2011) Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento (RUSC), 8 (1), pp. 117-164",Proc European Conf Games-based Learn,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939218351,1,1.0,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,university of brighton,university of brighton,academic blogging;academics;accept;account;activity;affordances;age;age kirkup;analysis;blogging;challenges;concepts;cost;create;development;digital;digital age;discussion;domain;economic rationalisation;education;engagement;environment;experience;experiences;explore;exposure;features;figure;form;formative experience;framework;innovation;inquiry;insight;institution refuse;institutions;intellectuals;investment;kirkup;landscape;low cost;marketisation;marketisation oltf;mean;means;media;medium siemens;networking;nonhierarchical structure;offer;oltf;online;online environment;opportunities;outlines;paper;position;potential opportunity;potential solution;present;pressures;professional development;public;public domain;rationalisation;reader;reflective;reflective account;reflexive;reflexive staff;refuse;responsive;rich insight;risk;siemens;social medium;solutions;staff;stages;structure;struggle;technological innovation;time;time investment;toofasttokeepup;vehicle;weller;weller mean;western world;workinprogress;world,academic blogging;blogging;development;professional development;reflections;vehicle,468

Through the user interface of VAM, the teacher can review the student's actions video, pick out the wrong actions and add still annotations. And the student can watch annotated video to find out mistakes and get instructions. In order to control over bandwidths Geometry Primitive Language is proposed, which presents the geometry primitives in XML. The results of experiment show that 80.9% out of students think that the V AM can afford the blended learning of physical education.

The resources needed for conventional lecture driven presentation like buildings, libraries, learning platform, Software, Internet Connectivity are scarce given at the rate of expansion that Rwanda needs. However, web-based systems are also not practical as yet, because connectivity is unreliable and limited in geographical coverage (though networks are being improved at a fast pace), so a 'low-tech' but electronic solution has been adopted by the National University of Rwanda (NUR) which we think will be viable even in remote areas. A strong blended learning system is being put in place to deliver multi-disciplinary degrees in the first instance, but with the intention of expanding into continuing professional development at all levels and to open routes to higher education for those who missed out or dropped out at the appropriate time. The system is in its infancy, but it looks promising as a solution to some of Rwanda's educational problems.

The design and implementation of blended learning is specific to the learning situation. Given the range of possible learning situations and the wide array of possible tools there are virtually endless possibilities for the blended learning designs. Those first embarking on blended learning ventures are faced with the task of surveying the vast quantity of resulting literature to gain a fundamental understanding of the concept and its implementation. For those beginning to implement blended learning in adult education contexts, this chapter attempts to provide a starting point for further exploration. This chapter seeks to lay foundations for understanding the concept of blended learning by firstly defining the term, and then highlighting key design concepts by discussing appropriate philosophical foundations and instructional design principles. An overview of some of the existing models and frameworks for blended learning in adult education is then given. Finally, some of the advantages and challenges of blended learning are discussed and future directions and research issues are identified.

This process was designed for training students in the use of NICTs and audiovisual media for use in the social and educational work with groups at risk of social exclusion. In order to do so, a curricular proposal was created based on the premises of the social and critical curricular focus aimed at motivating the students towards a critical consideration of the media and the NICTs and to convert this group not only into a receiver of information but also producers of the same. The use of this communication lies in putting forward certain ideas for feeding the debate on virtual pedagogical practices among the professionals who are fighting against social exclusion.

Institutional, national and global pressures demand that universities address issues of quality in teaching and learning. Universities are challenged to adapt their role to a new reality where two of the main concepts in this context are lifelong learning and mobility, which underlie the commitment of several European HE institutions following the Bologna Process. The purpose of this article is to examine the evaluation practices of teaching and learning in Portuguese Higher Education blended learning modules. Questions like who evaluates, how to evaluate, what is evaluated and what evaluation is for and also what should be implemented in order to improve course quality were put to the directors of the courses under scrutiny. The study was conducted with 18 of a total of 19 bLearning course directors in 11 Portuguese HE institutions. Results revealed that students, teachers and directors are the main performers of modules evaluation, although external agents are also seen as very relevant for this purpose in the near future. The main instruments used for evaluation are reports about the course and questionnaires to students. As to the objects of evaluation that are being selected in Portuguese institutions all directors mentioned the communication tools used, the quality of didactic materials and the pertinence of the learning tasks proposed, all of them also seen as most pertinent for the purposes of evaluation. The main goals of evaluation are the improvement of the curricular plans and the adequacy of the teaching strategies. Some recommendations of new methodologies for evaluation are put forward with the aim of improving HE teaching quality.

Increasingly, emphasis is being placed on the design of new learning spaces, often referred to as ""Next Generation Learning Spaces"" and their impact on pedagogy. The idea of ""classroom"" now incorporates the use of both physical and virtual space. This change has meant a greater focus on the design and use of flexible learning spaces, more use of blended learning approaches and more personalised, individualised learning opportunities for students. While many such classrooms have been built and utilised in universities globally, only a few formal studies have been reported on how these spaces are used by both teachers and students. This article focuses on a pilot study of the use by lecturers and students of a technology rich next generation learning space - the Pod Room - and makes recommendations for further research into the effectiveness of new learning spaces in universities.

This definition is based on the desire to combine and bring together two models of teaching-learning: thetraditional system of face-to-face learning and the e-learning system, maintaining the possibilities offered by each one. The aim of this article is to present the main results of a study to identify the characteristics of hybrid learning environments, which should be taken into account in their design and development. The research consisted of a case study of a hybrid postgraduate course taught at the University of Los Andes. An analysis was carried out on the set-up of the ten subjects of the course and on the impressions of students and lecturers throughout the programme which ran during the second half of 2006 and the first half of 2007. This approach allowed the identification of a teaching-learning proposal that was very positively rated by the lecturers and students that took part in the process. They all agreed that the learning objectives of the individual subjects and the programme as a whole had been achieved. Data were compiled using qualitative techniques (interviews, observation of physical and virtual classrooms) and quantitative techniques (surveys). The analysis of the results led to the identification of a series of characteristics of the hybrid model which could contribute to the general understanding of blended learning environments",blended learning;constructivist learning;hybrid environments;learning environment,,"Carman, J.M., (2002) Blended Learning Design: Five Key Ingredients, , http://www.agilantlearning.com/pdf/Blended%20Learning%20Design.pdf, articulo en linea; Duart, J.M., Gil, M., Pujol, M., Castano, J., (2008) La Universidad en la Sociedad Red, , Barcelona: UOC / Ariel. 1.a ed; Dziuban, C., Hartman, J.L., Moskal, P.D., Blended learning (2004) Educause Research Bulletin, 2004 (7). , Educause Center for Applied Research (ECAR); Graham, C.R., Blended learning systems.

This chapter focuses on the psychosocial dynamics of blended communities, in order to identify some specific participation strategies and identity dynamics, which both vary with the double interactive context. We used a qualitative variant of Social Network Analysis to analyse the interactions of two blended student communities, identifying various participation trajectories and identity positionings of the group members. The results revealed that the blending of two communication contexts generates different psychosocial dynamics from those activated by the same community in a wholly on- or offline context. The combination of interactive environments results in participation strategies in which members can choose distinctive trajectories, shaping their original identity positionings.

We intend to promote e-learning technologies in medical, pharmaceutical and health care domains. Using Java and XML technologies, we build models for various categories of wounds, due to various etiologies. Based on color and texture analysis, we identify the main barriers to wound healing, such as tissue non-viable, infection, inflammation, moisture imbalance, or edge non-advancing. This framework provides the infrastructure for preparing e-learning scenarios based on practice and real world experiences. We make experiments for wound healing simulation using various treatments and compare the results with experimental observations. Our experiments are supported by XML based databases containing knowledge extracted from previous wound healing experiences and from medical experts' knowledge. Also, we rely on new paradigms of the Artificial Intelligence for creating e-learning scenarios to be used in a context of active learning, for wound image understanding. To implement the e-learning tools, we use Java technologies for dynamic processes and XML technologies for dynamic content Our approach to e-learning is so called blended learning, which combines traditional face-to-face and Web-based on-line learning, with focus on principles of active learning.

The overall strategy is to create an introduction to autonomous and extracurricular CAD-learning, because the rather low credit-value prohibits a course extent that can cover the subject as broad and deep as necessary for design engineers. The main features of that concept are: • a standardized example project designed to give insight into as many modelling techniques and aspects as can be covered in a single-credit course • blended learning with a choice of alternative media, which means that different media and teaching concepts can be compared with regards to their suitability for CAD training • an option to choose from currently 3 different software products, which also means that the course can be used as a comparative study of different CAD-systems This approach could only be realized as a result of a collaboration of three different chairs of two universities and the willingness to consider this project not only as a teaching obligation but a systematic study of different engineering software solutions and alternative teaching concepts",blended learning;cad-education;multi-classroom teaching,blended learning;cad-education;comparative studies;design engineers;engineering software;modelling techniques;multi systems;software products;systematic study;curricula;engineering;product design;teaching;three dimensional;computer aided design,"Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education, , http://pacepartners.org, Website; Hesser, W., Stegemann, P., Umfrage Zur Struktur und Umfang der Ausbildung im Fachgebiet Technisches Zeichnen/Konstruktionslehre i an Deutschen Universitaten und Hochschulen, , http://www.pro-norm.de/pdf/ 2009_Auswertung_Umfrage_Maschinenzeichnen_Workshop_21_09_2009.pdf; Feldhusen, J., Brezing, A., Bungert, F., Lower, F., Yim, H., Lee, K., An interuniversitary education concept for collaborative product development (2008) International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, pp. 429-434. , EDPE 08 (proceedings).

The MedidaPrix (Mediendidaktischer Hochschulpreis) is an initiative that intends to function as a change agent exactly for this complex transformation process. Beginning in the year 2000, the Society for Media in Science (GMW) announces annually a highly endowed contest with an award sum of Euro 100,000. Participation is limited to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The award sum is funded by ministries of the countries mentioned and is earmarked for continuing project development. On the basis of the pattern movement,the authors discuss in this paper the different strategic measures set by the MedidaPrix Award to change the lock-up culture of learning materials currently found in higher education organizations and to promote high-quality material as open educational resources (OERs).

To this end, we undertake a brief analysis of the characteristics associated with electronic networks based on asynchronous written communication, and the prominence that they have acquired over the past years in the development of e-learning proposals, both within the framework of distance and blended education or of face-to-face education. Furthermore, this analysis emphasises those questions to which research in this field has not given a clear and satisfactory response. In order to make progress in explaining some of these questions, about a year ago Cultura & Educacion issued an open call for papers with the purpose of publishing a monograph issue on the subject. The papers that were finally selected for publication present research work carried out in diverse settings and educational levels, together with studies dealing with theoretical-methodological reflection and systematised experiences, preferably within the context of higher education. These studies help us understand the current state of research in our context.

Udayana University has implemented distance learning through its Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) since year 2007. Sharing and learning have been applied using video conference only or blended learning method. There is over than 400 hours and 1,500 participants who have joined the GDLN events every year. Wide ranges of topics have been delivered, such as education issues, health issues, and leadership issues. All the events and activities were then evaluated by analysing feedback results from the participants. Therefore the paper described satisfaction degrees of the learning events. The results show satisfied outcomes. Most participants, over than 80%, expressed their high level of satisfaction to the distance learning in the Udayana University. However the results show that the technology itself could not get most of the attention, it's really teaching strategies, contents, topics, tools and style which have the most impact on the quality of learning in distance programs. Hence facilitating learning communities at a distance requires some new, creative, and innovative approaches to the practice of managing the teaching and learning process",,global development;information communication technology;innovative approaches;learning community;level of satisfaction;quality of learning;satisfaction degrees;teaching and learning;information technology;learning systems;distance education,"American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) Glossary of Terms, , http://www.learningcircuits.org/glossary.html, DOI; (2002) Cultural and Financial Implications of an E-learning Approach, Butler Group's Intelligence Journal, , Butler Group April; Maguire, C., Zhang, J., (2007) Blended Learning in the Development Context: Experience with GDLN in Asia-Pacific, , http://www.jointokyo.org, Tokyo Development Learning Center.

Aim: To evaluate the additional educational value of a voluntary e-learning module in a nuclear medicine course for third-year medical students. Methods: Twenty exemplary nuclear medicine patient cases from our department were developed for e-learning purposes and presented on the internet using the web-based training program 'CaseTrain'. Subsequently, three selected test cases were handled and evaluated by an unselected population of third-year medical students. Results: One hundred and twenty-eight students studied the three patient cases and filled out the evaluation questionnaire completely. The most important result is that both the interest in and the subjective feeling of the knowledge level regarding the specialized field of nuclear medicine had increased significantly after working through the three e-learning cases. Ninety-seven percent of the evaluating students considered the use of computer-based learning useful. The subjective grading of the content of the cases and the handling of the software were graded with high marks by the participants, 1.9 and 2.0, respectively, on a linear scale with 1 being the best and 6 being the worst. Conclusion: The addition of e-learning to face-to-face teaching as a form of 'blended learning' is highly appreciated by medical students, and will provide an effective medium for bringing better understanding of nuclear medicine to future colleagues.

A key component is the adoption of Open Space Technology (OST) to group students according to their motivation for the topics to be studied and tasks to be performed, rather than following their personal affinities. We have developed and tested the strategy throughout two academic years. In the first year, we explored OST in its regular, face-to-face, approach. Although the results were good, we felt that learning could be further improved with a period of on-line discussion after the face-to-face session. With this in mind, in the following year we explored a combination of face-to-face and on-line activities, in what we called blended-OST (or b-OST). We concluded that this approach could lead to a deeper discussion of the proposed tasks, to the emergence of additional possible tasks, and to the participation of students who tended to shy away from expressing their opinions orally. The data collected shows that the involvement of the students increased in the second year. In our view, the use of blended-OST has contributed to the creation of a better learning context. The students' opinions, collected after the course, also support this view.

In addition to the collaborative media, the platform includes teaching and learning by using interactive lecture videos. Unlike conventional video recording, interactive videos give students the opportunity to learn more about any topic with the help of additional information.

One of the main limitations of fully implementing 3D imaging in the sonography department is the limited experience and limited time to educate working sonographers on how to fully understand and use this technology. Deliberate and planned educational activities designed to meet the educational needs of working sonographers may be a way to increase the clinical use of 3D technology in the clinical sonography department. ,3d sonography;hybrid (blended) learning;teaching,article;echography;health survey;learning theory;paramedical education;priority journal;technology;three dimensional imaging,"Jenkins, C., Monaghan, M.J., Shirali, G., Marwick, T.H., Crop till you drop: Defining the learning curve for 3D echocardiography (2006) Eur J Echocardiogr, 7, p. 125; El-Gayar, O., Dennis, T., Effectiveness of hybrid learning environments (2005) Issues Inf Syst, 6, pp. 176-182; Benacerraf, B.R., Shipp, T.D., Bromley, B., Improving the efficiency of gynecologic sonography with 3-dimensional volumes (2006) J Ultrasound Med, 25, pp. 165-171; Hagel, J., Bicknell, S.G., Impact on 3D sonography on workroom time efficiency (2007) AJR, 188, pp. 966-969; Reynard, R., Hybrid Learning: Maximizing Student Engagement, , http://campustechonogy.com/articles/482041/; Chatterjea, K., Asynchronous learning using a hybrid learning package: A teacher developmental strategy in geography (2004) J Organ End User Comput, 16, pp. 37-54",J Diagn Med Sonogr,Article,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649879222,5,0.2,United States,United States,university of wisconsin milwaukee;university of wisconsin hospital and clinics;oconomowoc memorial hospital,university of wisconsin milwaukee,activities;clinical sonography;clinical use;condition;deliberate;department;educate;educational activity;educational need;experience;increase;limitations;limited experience;limited time;main limitation;means;meet;needs;pathological condition;patient;sonographers;sonography;sonography department;technology;threedimensional sonography;time;understand;use;way,hybrid;hybrid learning;sonographers;teach;technology;theory,495

The up-and-coming massive e-learning and blended learning projects are clear examples of such a phenomenon. The teaching of oral communication offers a perfect scenario to experiment with these formulas. Since the traditional face to face approach for teaching 'Speech techniques' does not keep up with the new digital environment that surround students, it is necessary to move towards an 'Online oratory' model focused on using TEL to improve oral skills. Valladolid University offers a subject called 'Tecnicas de Expresion Oral' (Speech techniques) for an advertising and PR degree. Jon Dornaleteche has been the teacher in charged of it in the last four years. This paper summarizes all the achievements obtained by means of the application of ITCs and proposes a didactic guide to help teachers change their methods.

The rationale for designing and including the online modules in the subject was to develop information and communication technology (ICT) skills, and to deliver a blended learning approach, argued by some to be more effective, that is, have more advantages than traditional approaches. In this paper, the face-to-face teaching alongside the eLearning that occurred in the blended learning approach is analysed using Tom Reeves and John Hedberg's model (2003) for evaluating interactive learning systems. Arguably, this evaluation model can be usefully applied to higher education teaching that is not fully online, and can help to comprise an integral part of an action research approach. This paper is a 'proof of concept' piece, demonstrating the applicability of the model to a blended learning course. Demonstrating the application of Reeves and Hedberg's model fills a knowledge void on the literature surrounding blended learning.

Methods: All (34) departments of nuclear medicine at German university hospitals were asked to participate in an anonymized online survey. Questions were categorized into four topics: 1.) clinic and education; 2.) on-site strategies for e-learning; 3.) available e-learning offers and 4.) free text comments on experiences and expectations. All input was reviewed descriptively; free text was analyzed analytically. Results: The response rate was 56% (19/34). 13/19 responses indicated well-defined e-learning strategies, mainly to support frontal teaching courses. Future e-learning perspectives focus on clinical case studies with sufficient imaging materials. Only 7/19 university hospitals operate a centralized e-learning platform (e. g. Moodle). The acceptance of the available e-learning options by the students is considered relatively poor. Conclusions: Today e-learning concepts for nuclear medicine are available at selected university hospitals only. All responders wish to expand on e-learning but many report the lack of administrative support to do so. These data could be regarded as a basis for discussions of inter-university teaching scenarios.

But, this transformation must occur taking our society, culture and economy into consideration. Blended learning approach can be the pathway of success towards that direction. Sloan has aptly stated, ""Blended learning is the sleeping giant that will transform higher education pedagogically, culturally and institutionally."" Blended learning means the comprehensive instructional approach for providing socialized, constructivist and sustainable learning experiences through the meaningful integration of face-to-face interactions and e-learning techniques. This approach will be able to make learning process more efficient, easy, socialized, well-organized and Professional. Through this approach, we can bring the dream of time relevant, quality assured and student centered higher education for the new Millennium in reality. This will be the first step of education towards making India a superpower.

In this paper, the proposed combination is teaching in class and reviewing after class using an on-line free-text scoring assessment system. In our first experiments with non Computer Science university students, we asked their teachers to motivate them with the possibility of getting more training for the final exam. However, only 5 students (11% of the class) reviewed with the computer after class on a regular basis. Therefore, we studied and applied a set of principles to improve the motivation of using the Blended Learning approach, and to get more students to review after class. After applying these principles 78% of the non Computer Science university students reviewed with the computer on a regular basis",assessment methods;blended learning;motivation;technology enhanced learning,assessment methods;assessment system;blended learning;computer-based educations;face-to-face instruction;technology enhanced learning;university students;computer science;motivation;personnel training;students;engineering education,"Beatty-Guenter, P., Distance education: Does access override success?

This framework was set up in the context of the Socrates Comenius 2.1 European project: ""VccSSe - Virtual Community Collaborating Space for Science Education"". In this project, teachers from five European countries (Romania, Poland, Finland, Spain and Greece) participated in blended learning courses aiming their training for the use of Information and Communication Technologies in real teaching and learning practices. Within this framework, on-line training materials and virtual experiments were created and developed. After the end of the designed courses, teachers were asked to form their own virtual experiments and lesson plans and then to implement their products in the classrooms. The analysis of the data shows that teachers who participated in the VccSSe Project encouraged by the aforementioned blended course, expressed a favourable feedback related to the implementation of their own virtual experiments in the teaching activities",blended learning;computer supported education;teacher training;virtual experiments,blended learning;collaborative spaces;essential considerations;european countries;european project;finland;information and communication technologies;lesson plans;online training;romania;science education;teacher training;teaching and learning;virtual community;virtual experiments;experiments;personnel training;planning;virtual reality;teaching,"Balacheff, N., Kaput, J., Computer-based learning environments in mathematics (1996) International Handbook on Mathematics Education, pp. 469-501. , A.

Our aim is to assess the applicability of Second Life for collaborative learning by developing virtual tools and metaphors and exploiting the representational richness of this novel medium. In order to enhance the existing metaphors and affordances of SL, our research team implemented educational spaces, avatar clothing, and tools for non-verbal communication and visualisation. By implementing a blended learning evaluation approach we attempted to answer three research questions focusing on student collaboration, avatar representation and learning space awareness. We can conclude that SL can supplement and/or augment face to face interactions, improving upon previous approaches in distance collaboration and communication.

It then examines the possibility of developing specific professional competences in higher education by means of a teaching experience that has been ongoing for over ten years: the course entitled Training in professional competences (I and II). The study ends by showing how this blended learning course, which makes full use of participative methodologies, promotes the development of professional competences including knowledge, attitudes and skills, and also encourages students to acquire intellectual and participative competences which raise their awareness and enable them to play an active role in their professional and social advancement",educational attitudes;educational methods;educational strategies;professional training,,"Alvarez de Mon, S., Liderazgo: 10 lecciones desde la crisis.

The perspective adopted is that of a public body (the Autonomous Province of Trento) which is investing a great deal in e-learning. In these circumstances it has been noticed that e-learning poses a series of questions concerning the costs/compensation of the resources involved. A traditional cost model based on the hourly pay of teachers and tutors implies two risks: on the one hand, to consider e-learning activities comparatively inexpensive to traditional training; on the other hand, to undervalue the role of the actors involved in the e-learning process, despite the continuous contribution they must give to support effective learning. In fact, in the learning process it is necessary to alternate individual assignments with other activities to favour reflection, in depth-examination, clarification and also personalized feedback.

The students taking the course gain familiarity in design, fabrication, and testing in an area of photonics that is destined to play an increasingly important, and in the long run ubiquitous, role in optical circuitry, impacting on areas such as optical interconnects, communications systems, and sensor systems. The course is structured using a blended-learning pedagogical approach consisting of an on-site workshop followed by designbased e-learning. The students' designs are fabricated using IMEC's passive photonic cSOI process, which is accessed through the European silicon photonics prototyping service ePIXfab. Student projects to date have included the design of integratedoptical circuits using combinations of ring resonators, waveguides, couplers, and photonic crystals for applications such as filters for WDM optical interconnects, demodulators for phase modulated signals, and lab-on-chip sensors.

Mature-age study brings with it some special features, such as time use limitations, which must be taken into account when creating educational programmes for the students concerned. Above all, flexibility must become a major feature of participation in education. In relation to the Master Studies in Mathematical Information Technology at Kokkola University Consortium, the aim for some years now has been to increase that flexibility by diversifying traditional lecture teaching with the help of real-time and on-demand video lectures. With the help of the results presented in this paper we set to evaluate the suitability of the practice used with video lectures to diversify education in circumstances where the students are working adults and, in addition, where many of them live far from the campus area. According to the results, studying with the help of videos suits well to adult working students. Introduction of videos decreases participation in face-to-face teaching, but, as a whole, participation may even increase once videos have become available. Clearly, the most common use purpose for the videos is to compensate for the absences from face-to-face teaching. Due to their flexibility, on-demand videos are particularly suitable for this purpose. Also, participation in real time education, either with the help of videos or face-to-face teaching, seems popular.

We intend to promote e-learning technologies in medical, pharmaceutical and health care domains. Using Java and XML technologies, we build models for various categories of wounds, due to various etiologies. Based on color and texture analysis, we identify the main barriers to wound healing, such as tissue non-viable, infection, inflammation, moisture imbalance, or edge non-advancing. This framework provides the infrastructure for preparing e-learning scenarios based on practice and real world experiences. We make experiments for wound healing simulation using various treatments and compare the results with experimental observations. Our experiments are supported by XML based databases containing knowledge extracted from previous wound healing experiences and from medical experts' knowledge. Also, we rely on new paradigms of the Artificial Intelligence for creating e-learning scenarios to be used in a context of active learning, for wound image understanding. To implement the e-learning tools, we use Java technologies for dynamic processes and XML technologies for dynamic content. Our approach to e-learning is so called blended learning, which combines traditional face-to-face and Web-based on-line learning, with focus on principles of active learning.

The current debate on design education shows us a landscape of different initiatives. So far difficulties have arisen in the area of accreditation and validation of interaction design as an educational field. This in contrast to all the EU agreements and strategies. In this paper we will closely look at these difficulties from the perspective of the intensive EU-funded summer-course on Interaction Design with four participating institutes coming from four different EU countries. The course facilitated learning through the usage of the didactic format of studio-based group-work. This approach enabled blended learning and provided a commongroud for intercultural learning through design. A qualitative assessment conducted on the learning format by the 40 multi-cultural group of students and staff provided insightful guidelines into the appreciation and value of the format. The evaluation results showed that the studio-based group-work is an efficient method to overcome cultural differences in design methodology, teamwork and personal skills.

However, the lack of degree-level courses designed for TEVET personnel at both of Zambia's universities prevented progress. This situation has disadvantaged TEVET staff and for years has limited their professional development. To address this, a pilot project involving a British Higher Education Institution delivering a degree programme, in-country and in-service (part-time), was proposed by senior DTEVT staff. Some seven years after the commencement of this programme and with three cohorts having successfully been completed, this paper examines some of the key issues in delivery of the programme over the years and reflects on significant events that have influenced the programme's development and are likely to continue to impact on its future direction.

The main aim is to analyse the three different components of this ""blended learning"" pedagogical approach, as well as the way they complement each other and to address a few of the challenges that have emerged from the experience of working with them so far. The eModules are an eLearning platform that has been designed with the purpose of offering a structured and interactive way of learning how the European Union functions. The face-to-face training component currently takes the form of three days in-house seminars, covering in an intensive manner the most important areas of the curriculum. The lectures are held by a mix of academics and practitioners, ensuring a balanced approach, in which theory and practice come together to facilitate the learning experience. The third element of the ""blended learning"" method is placed in-between online and face-to-face learning: interactive seminars and debates are held online, giving the participants the chance to deepen their knowledge in certain fields of interest and to discuss the content of the course with specialists and among themselves. The mixture of delivery and interaction methods was chosen in order to accommodate a large variety of target groups, ranging from students to professionals working with EU-related issues, with different backgrounds and geographical origins.

On-line educational systems and virtual learning environments are proliferating, without the need for printed materials. This means that students' ability to take notes may decline, as they prefer to use on-line methods. To examine this phenomenon, students' notes were assessed by a lecturer. Note-taking was surveyed during two economics courses which were taught by the same professor. These two courses were a blended learning course and a fully on-line course in a bachelor level program at a Japanese university. The lecturer also reviewed and assessed each student's notes after the sessions each week. Their learning performance was measured using on-line tests, written essays and a final exam. The total number of participants for the two courses was 199. There were 97 in the blended learning course and 102 in the fully on-line course. The note-taking assessment scores changed weekly, in accordance with the contents of the course. The assessment scores for note-taking correlate with essay report assessments and final exams (r = 0.49) for the blended learning course, and correlate with tests and final exams for the fully on-line course.

It proposes that the property scholar, either in academia or in industry, should be an exemplar for the property profession. Using the think-learn-act framework, the paper considers the role of the exemplar and highlights the rethinking of brain functionality, the findings on blended learning and student engagement as challenging activities of the exemplar. There is an illustration of a property learning case on investment valuation within a blended learning environment. The paper looks at the future role of the exemplar and includes proposals on the scholarly challenge, virtual learning environments, academic collaboration, marketbased research and meaningful industry interaction. The paper concludes with an emphasis on enhanced communication and collaboration.

It is generally observed that a considerable number of university students in the Czech Republic use online communication tools and feel comfortable keeping in touch with other people by means of computer mediated communication. However, not only these productive skills, but also soft skills, such as the ability to work collaboratively and to communicate in teams, should be developed at the tertiary level of education. This can be done mainly in the courses that focus on communication, including English language courses. The language component of communicative competence comprises not only grammatical and lexical knowledge, but also pragmatic competence, i. e. the ability to appropriately use language forms with particular communication purposes and the ability to interpret such forms correctly. Yet, in many English language courses, the ability to effectively communicate online is not paid much attention to, or is often reduced to language accuracy. Moreover, online textual communication is different from purely written communication, as well as from spoken face-to-face interaction, and these aspects of computer mediated communication should also be reflected in English language courses that prepare students to communicate online. This paper tries to offer certain possibilities to meet the above-mentioned requirements. It presents the results obtained in a pilot study on developing communicative competence in English language courses for university students at the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) A2 level. The aim of this paper is to clarify the key principles of developing communicative competence. Along with the theoretical basis, the methodology of designing online communicative tasks and using asynchronous discussion forums are introduced. Important characteristics of online communicative activities are discussed and the process of introducing, maintaining, closing and assessing online communicative activities is presented. Finally, the question whether the online communicative activities can lead to better comprehension as well as better production of the target language is answered on the basis of evaluation of reading and writing test results. Selected students' progress throughout the course is then evaluated, considering both qualitative and quantitative aspects of student participation in the communicative online activities",blended learning;communicative competence;computer-mediated communication (cmc);discussion forums;english as a foreign language (efl) learning,curricula;students;blended learning;communicative competences;computer-mediated communication;discussion forum;english-as-a-foreign-language;communication,"Bachman, L., (1990) Fundamental Considerations in Language Testing, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bachman, L., (2004) Statistical Analyses for Language Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; (2003) Cambridge Key English Test 2 with Answers: Examination Papers from the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; (2001) Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, , http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Source/Framework_EN.pdf; Cerna, M., Blended learning experience in teacher education: The trainees' perspective (2009) Acta Didactica Napocensia, 2 (1), pp. 37-48. , March; Palloff, R.M., Pratt, K., (2007) Building Online Learning Communities: Effective Strategies for the Virtual Classroom, , 2nd ed.

This chapter explores the blended learning practices by investigating two higher educational institutions in the UK and Malaysia. First, the strategies and practices related to blended learning are clearly analysed and compared. A large amount of qualitative data extracted from academics' experience is discussed. Primarily, the findings firmly show that blended learning enables educators to revisit and to rethink their professional ethos and values, and redesign their learning and teaching where necessary. Such revisiting and rethinking facilitate the awareness and praxis of blended learning (or vice-versa: blended learning facilitates the revisit and redesign). The in-depth discussions based on academics' voices, and reflective matrix summary from the case studies described in this chapter will act as evidence of the blueprint for blended learning policy makers and practitioners.

This case study reports on the first stages of planning and implementation of an institution-wide project to enhance teaching and learning quality at a remote and regional university, where one of the major strategies for improvement is peer review. Through a systematic process of staff engagement in peer review, within and from outside the organisation, a substantial change in flexible learning is envisaged. A mix of new and different learning spaces are to be used in the project, including blended learning spaces for academic development. This paper describes the research framework that will guide the peer review process and examines the early findings of the design-based research. Leadership, awareness raising and development of a supportive community of inquiry are seen as key components for successful implementation of peer review. In addition, unique contextual elements add to the complexity of designing for transformative change within such a relatively new organization.

Two roles have been studied: the tutor, acting during forum-discussions, and the editor, in charge of supervising a collaborative writing task. A quantitative analysis was conducted to verify the impact of the two roles in terms of: a) participation to online activities, b) students' preference for one of the roles and c) students'perception about the relevance of roles in acquiring academic skills. 48 in-service teachers attending a blended course responded to a 9-items semi-structured questionnaire. Their participation was measured by counting their reading and writing activities. Results show that the highest participation is obtained when participants could play both roles. Participants prefer one or the other role based on specific motivations reported on the questionnaire. The motivations were categorized by using four theoretical metaphors: behaviorist, cognitive, constructivist, and socio-constructivist motivations. Lower participants report more behaviorist motivations whereas higher participants have socio-constructivist argumentations. Both roles are perceived as useful to foster participation and improve communication and collaboration skills. Nevertheless, the role of the editor is perceived as more useful than that of the tutor in promoting both online and offline participation and individual learning",blended learning;e-tutor;knowledge building;role-taking,,"(2006) The Handbook of Blended Learning: Global Perspectives, Local Designs, , Bonk C.

Too much attention was given to the technological aspects. Teachers learned to work with hard- and software. A typical example is the European Computer Driving License (ECDL). A lot of people attend courses on text processing, spreadsheets... but using a Virtual Learning Environment like e.g. Blackboard or Moodle demands more didactical than technical skills. Especially e-learning and blended learning is too demanding to let teachers learn to use these tools only by experimenting. More and more is generally accepted that the e-learning competencies for teachers require a longer course. Which competences and how these can be realized is the main focus of this paper?

The importance of the software to enable student created content, storage, and sharing of knowledge is reviewed. This chapter provides an evaluation of some of the affordances and constraints of wikis to promote critical thinking within a blended learning context. It assesses their potential to facilitate collaborative learning through community focused enquiry for geographically separated students and nomadic learners. One particular focus of the chapter is the development of new digital literacies and how students present their written work in wikis. The chapter also examines group dynamics within collaborative learning environments drawing on the data from a study conducted at the University of Plymouth in 2007, using wikis in teacher education. Finally, the chapter highlights some recent key contributions to the developing discourse on social software in what has been termed 'the architecture of participation.'.

Its application to an English for Academic Study programme, provides a framework for the development of a constructivist environment which supports collaborative and active learning experiences in a blended space. Using a questionnaire, students evaluated four learning activities based on the R2D2 model. Although limited in terms of its data gathering method, the evaluation of the R2D2 model was an initial enquiry into its perceived benefits by students. Analysis suggests that the results were favourable, giving insights into the importance to learners of real-life activities, which assist the learning of academic skills for vocabulary acquisition, pronunciation, note taking and presentations.

This phenomenon, known as 'blended' learning, has become part of the educational provision of most 'conventional' on-campus universities. The present study investigated how conceptions of teaching and eTeaching, both sides of the 'blended' experience, are associated. Three conceptions of 'blended' teaching were proposed as emerging from these associations: 1) as a disintegrated way of supporting transmission of information, 2) as a 'dissonant' way of combining face-to-face and online tasks and activities; and 3) as an embedded way of supporting students' learning. Conceptions one and three suggested that teachers tended to conceive of teaching 'consonantly' both face to face and online. Conception two represented an un-expected pattern of association. These results have important implications for eTeaching development programs. Not only technical skills should be emphasised, but also teachers' pedagogical awareness as those who held student-focused conceptions of teaching seemed to be more likely of conceiving of eTeaching as a medium for supporting quality learning experiences.

Due to the transformation of the traditional German degree programs to an educational system based on two cycles (bachelor/master), a new curriculum had to be performed. The curricula and the according lectures were derived based on a review of demands on product developers. This review and the resulting educational concept are presented in this paper. While setting up the lectures, one of the aims for education in engineering design was to build up and emphasize a close relationship between engineering design, engineering mechanics, materials engineering and production technology. Some of the courses, especially a CAD course and a product development and design project, are explained more in detail. In the first mentioned course, a modern way of computer-supported, ""blended learning"" was realized. In the second mentioned course, new ground was broken by applying subject-specific knowledge in combination with soft skills by offering an obligatory project already in the bachelor program",curriculum redesign;engineering design education;methodological and practical training,bachelor programs;blended learning;cad course;degree program;design projects;educational systems;engineering design;engineering design education;engineering mechanics;materials engineering;methodological and practical training;product developers;production technology;soft skills;subject-specific;curricula;design;product development;professional aspects;engineering education,"Eckardt, P., (2005) Der Bologna Prozess, Entstehung, Strukturen und Ziele der Europaischen Hochschulreformpolitik; Leszczensky, M., Wolter, A., (2005) Der Bologna Prozess im Spiegel der HIS-Hochschulforsch-ung, , Hcchschul-Informations-System, Hannover; Adamsson, N., Grimheden, M., The product developer: Education and professional role (2007) 16 th International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED '07, , Paris, August; Eder, W.E., Hubka, V., Curriculum, pedagogics and didactics for design education (2001) 13 th International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED '01, , Glasgow, August; (2008) VDI-Ingenieurstudie, , VDI-Wissensforum (Ed.)

The teaching methodology of these courses has been developed to comply with the new challenges of the education in technology. Presently six of the courses in the curriculum are following the schemes explained in this presentation. The courses are studied in the last year of the Bachelor level and in the Masters level quantifying from 2 to 4 ECTS credits. Students get all the material from the teaching platform in the web, which can be accessed freely anytime and practically from anywhere. Before attending the teaching events, the students go through the study material, perform several exercises and take a quiz, which can give them extra points for the exam tally. The contact teaching of the course is divided into four Learning Sessions of four hours. The first half is reserved to deepen the acquired knowledge, and performed in a way to attract a more interactive atmosphere. In the second half the students are divided to groups, where they solve more difficult study exercises compared to those they already have trained on. As the students are expected to study with the material of blended learning in advance, the percentage of the contact hours has to be lowered in comparison to the traditional teaching in order to maintain a balance with the credits in the course. However, with the acquired knowledge, the students are more interactive with the teachers and the teaching becomes more efficient. The students have given positive feedback on the courses. The instructors have found that the blended learning is not necessary an easier task, although there are less contact hours with the student. The efficiency of teaching has increased and the teaching is more rewarding. Both the students and the teachers found that blended education suited best for student groups around 10 students.

The research has been carried out as part of a one year Academic Practice Award which is being delivered by staff in the Department of Design and Technology at Loughborough University (June 2008 - June 2009) and aims to develop new teaching material for teaching ethics via blended learning. Although the teaching of ethics is recognized as being important in design and engineering, the practice of doing so has only become established in the last five years and only by a limited number of institutions. This paper presents the types of issues that are currently being taught to students on a range of different types of design courses in the US and Europe. It also draws on the literature to reflect on additional methods which might be appropriate for teaching ethics in design. The lessons learned will be fed into the development of new material for integrating ethics into the teaching of design and technology students",ethics teaching;product design,blended learning;department of design;design and technology;design course;ethics teachings;loughborough university;new teaching;teaching ethics;engineering education;philosophical aspects;product design;curricula,"Lilley, D., (2007) Designing for Behavioural Change: Reducing the Social Impacts of Product Use Through Design, , Department of Design and Technology, Loughborough University; Bhamra, T.A., Lilley, D., Tang, T., Sustainable Use: Changing consumer behaviour through product design (2008) Changing the Change: Design Visions, Proposals and Tools., , Turin, Italy; Berdichevsky, D., Neuenschwander, E., Towards an ethics of persuasive technology (1999) Communications of the ACM, 42 (5), pp. 51-58; Wareham, D.G., Takis Elefsiniotis, P., Elms, D.G., Introducing ethics using structured controversies (2006) European Journal of Engineering Education, 31 (6), pp. 651-660; Devries, M.J., Ethics and the complexity of technology: A design approach (2006) Philosophia Reformata, the International Scientific Journal of the Association for Reformational Philosophy, 71 (2), pp. 118-131; Albrechtslund, A., Ethics and technology design (2007) Ethics and Information Technology, 9, pp. 63-72; (2006) Code of Ethics, , http://www.ieee.org/web/membership/ethics/codeethics.html; (2005) Inter-Disciplinary Ethics Applied Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, , http://www.idea.leeds.ac.uk/, IDEA∼CETL: University of Leeds, UK; (2005) An Engineering Ethics Curriculum Map, , RAEng and EPC, London, UK: The Teaching Engineering Ethics Working Group (TEEG) of the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) and the Engineering Professors Council (EPC); (1999), http://www.idsa.org, Industrial Design Society of America; Heskett, J., (1991) Industrial Design, p. 215. , London: Thames and Hudson; Tovey, M., Styling and design: Intuition and analysis in industrial design (1997) Design Studies, 18 (1), pp. 5-31; Langrish, J., Case studies as a biological research process (1993) Design Studies: Special Issue.

The case study describes the history of origins and examines the educational situation before this master's program was established and how an idea became reality. It is one of the very few possibilities in Germany to receive a deeper insight into criminology and police science. Despite the fact, that the students are all professionals and thus working mostly full time, the technical premises make a discourse possible as in on-campus programs. These innovative forms of learning are the focal point of the following case study.

Within academic development, and as both designers and tutors in blended PBL, it is important to seek best practices for how to combine instructional strategies in face-to-face and computer-mediated environments that take advantage of the strengths of each and avoid their weaknesses. A qualitative study of the lived experiences of 17 academic staff participants in a blended problem-based learning module was considered likely to provide a much-needed analysis of current thinking and practice on the potential of interaction in this form of professional academic development in higher education. Specific aspects of interaction (technical, peer, content and the learning experience) within blended problem-based learning tutorials are analysed to provides research-based information about the realities of delivering a PBL programme using technology. The study will argue that the intersection of PBL and learning technologies can offer different ways of teaching and learning that require exploration and reflection of pedagogy and technology as in integrated approach that must work effectively together. The synergy from the collaborative blended PBL approach in this module could result in the coherent and comprehensive provision of training, support and research work throughout higher education institutions",blended learning;computer mediated conferencing;interaction;problem-based learning;transformation,blended learning;computer-mediated environment;higher education institutions;instructional strategy;interaction;problem based learning;teaching and learning;transformation;engineering education;teaching;technology;e-learning,"Calvert, J., Achieving development goals - Open and distance learning (2006) Lessons and Issues, , http://pcf4.dec.uwi.edu/overview.php, last accessed 14 March 2007; Carr, N., Wikis, knowledge building communities and authentic pedagogies in preservice teacher education (2008) The ASCILATE Conference, , Paper presented at Melbourne; Gale, K., Wheeler, S., Kelly, P., Learning in cyberspace: An examination of changes in professional identity and practice style in an online problem based learning environment (2008) Quarterly Review of Distance Education, 8 (4), pp. 297-307; Pardo, A., Kloos, C., Combining web 2.0 technology and problem-based learning in a blended learning environment (2009) International Journal of Continuing Engineering Education and Life-Long Learning, 19 (2-3), pp. 222-231","IADIS Int Conf Cogn Explor Learn Digit Age, CELDA",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882930936,1,1.0,Ireland,Ireland,teaching and technology centre,teaching and technology centre,academic development;academic staff;advantage;analysis;approach;argue;aspects;avoid;brief;brief paper;coherent;collaborative;combine;combine instructional;comprehensive;comprehensive provision;content;context;current thinking;designers;development;different way;discuss;education;education institution;environments;experience;experiences;exploration;facetoface;form;information;institutions;instructional strategy;interaction;intersection;module;offer;paper;participants;pbl;pbl approach;pbl programme;pedagogy;peer;practice;practices;professional academic;programme;provide;provision;qualitative;qualitative study;realities;reflection;require;require exploration;research;research work;result;role;seek;specific aspect;staff;staff participant;strategies;strengths;study;support;synergy;technologies;technology;training;tutorials;tutors;ways;weaknesses;work,communities;interaction;transformation,549

Computers can make the teaching process dynamic and rich, since they enable the access to the foreign language through virtual environments, which creates a larger number of learning contexts, with all their specific vocabulary and linguistic features in real communication. This study focuses on possible applications of this kind of approach. The computer online is a resource of diverse textual genres and can be an important tool in the language classroom as well as an access to authentic material produced in contextualized practice close to real-life communication. On the other hand, all these materials must be appropriately used without ever worshipping the technology as if it were a miraculous solution. After all, the professional pedagogic skills of the teacher should never be forgotten or taken for granted. In this study, a series of interviews with teachers was carried out - both with Brazilian teachers of the public sector (basic education) and language institutes (private English courses) as well as teacher trainers (university professors), in order to verify if the teachers were prepared to work with informatics in teaching practices, and check the professionals' views on the subject. The ideas of Maingueneau and Marcuschi about textual genres are a theoretical base in this work, besides the concept of cognitive economy. The text and its typology are focused here as the basic material for teaching English, through digital technologies and hypermedia. The study is also based on Sharma and Barrett's notion of blended learning as a balanced combination of technological resources and traditional practices in the classroom. Thus, this is an attempt to investigate the relevance of information and communication technologies in the education and professional practice of English teachers in Brazil in the context of the 21st century.

This model allows to design instructional programs oriented to maximize the balance of the student's intelligence skills in a blended learning. The fundamentals of our learning-teaching model are sustained on the main principles of the Triarchic Theory of (Successful) Human Intelligence conceived by the psychologist Robert Sternberg. This author claims that there are three branches of Intelligence (analytical, practical and creative), all of them being necessary in different moments of ones' life. ILEM comprises an online and a face-to-face components. The former is supported by an adaptive hypermedia application whereas the latter, the presential one, is based essentially on group work.

The system generates different work plans for each student, according to their profile. Work plans are adapted by means of an algorithm. AHS enable course contents to be adapted to the learning needs of each student and structured in a way that leads to many different learning paths. The case study method was used in this research. The results suggest that the AHS has a positive impact on the learning process. Further research is needed to confirm these results.

In this system we take advantage of multimedia technologies for communicating, sparking the interest of the students in geometry and supporting the spatial visualization processes in learning descriptive geometry. In such a way of blended learning, e-based materials and e-tutoring are combined with face-to-face sessions, lectures and labs. The e-learning system supports the students in their self-paced learning and in solving the homework assignments. Components in the system are for example: discussion forums and chat, summaries of each lecture in flash movies, hyperlinks as well as virtual models. In this paper the content of the e-learning system will be presented in the interactions with the face-to-face sessions. The use of the system and the effectiveness of the tools for the students' learning processes were evaluated at the end of the semester. The results of the evaluation will be presented and discussed.

We intend to promote e-learning technologies in medical, pharmaceutical and health care domains. Using Java and XML technologies, we build models for various categories of wounds, due to various etiologies. Based on color and texture analysis, we identify the main barriers to wound healing, such as tissue non-viable, infection, inflammation, moisture imbalance, or edge nonadvancing. This framework provides the infrastructure for preparing e-learning scenarios based on practice and real world experiences. We make experiments for wound healing simulation using various treatments and compare the results with experimental observations. Our experiments are supported by XML based databases containing knowledge extracted from previous wound healing experiences and from medical experts' knowledge. Also, we rely on new paradigms of the Artificial Intelligence for creating e-learning scenarios to be used in a context of active learning, for wound image understanding. To implement the e-learning tools, we use Java technologies for dynamic processes and XML technologies for dynamic content. Our approach to e-learning is so called blended learning, which combines traditional face-to-face and Web-based on-line learning, with focus on principles of active learning.

The Sloan-C Pillars (learning effectiveness, access, cost effectiveness, student satisfaction, and faculty satisfaction) provide a foundation for the evaluation of asynchronous learning networks that works equally well for the evaluation of blended learning environments. The Pillars and a simplified model of a learning system, focus on inputs, processes, and outputs, and provide the framework for a case study of blended learning design and evaluation in a 500-student section of an Introductory Psychology course. Results of a multi-method evaluation of this course indicated very high levels of both learning effectiveness and student satisfaction.

A blended learning model is presented that suggests teachers design instruction to meet the needs of a variety of learners. Specifically, Blending with Purpose: The Multimodal Model recognizes that because learners represent different generations, different personality types, and different learning styles, teachers and instructional designers should seek to use multiple approaches including face-to-face methods and online technologies that meet the needs of a wide spectrum of students. A major benefit of multiple modalities is that they allow students to experience learning in ways in which they are most comfortable while also challenging them to experience and learn in other ways as well. Critical to this model is the concept that academic program and course goals and objectives drive the pedagogical approaches and technologies used. Issues related to definitions of blended learning, how teachers and students use technology, generational characteristics among student populations, and learning styles are examined",asynchronous learning;blended learning;computer-mediated communications;computer-mediated learning;distance learning;instructional design;instructional technology;learning styles;multiple modalities;online learning,,"Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2008) Online Nation: Five Years of Growth In Online Learning, , http://www.sloan-c.org/publications/survey/pdf/online_nation.pdf, Needham, MA: The Sloan Consortium, 2007; Masie, E., E-Learning, the Near Future (2003) The AMA Handbook of E-Learning, pp. 411-418. , G.

This article describes the prospects and risks of blended learning and e-learning for information retrieval courses. It deals with adequate content presentation and representation, as well as with interaction concepts and didactic considerations concerning the cost-benefit ratio of animations, applets, and multimedia elements. We present lessons learnt from 6 years of teaching information retrieval in blended learning and pure e-learning scenarios, and derive graded concepts for basic and advanced topics based on a book-like content representation on the one side, and lecture-recordings on the other side. Each concept is complemented by a pragmatic and focussed use of auxiliary elements such as forums and self-tests. Examples for beneficial and misguided applets and animations are given, along with criteria for their differentiation. Finally, critical success factors for technology enhanced learning approaches in the information retrieval field are derived concerning the creation, utilisation, and maintenance of courses. In short, we will argue that taking into account the nature and stability of the presented content, as well as a thorough consideration of the affordable creation and maintenance effort, are crucial for the success of such concepts. In addition, the closer the concept is to pure e-learning, the more important a high digital presence of the lecturer becomes.

This article describes the assessment of three digital artefacts where the assessor strove to understand, rather than rate the students and their achievement. Three distinct approaches were followed. The first was positivist, rubric-based. The second was post-structural/interpretive, with groupwork and peer assessment. The third was feminist/holistic relying principally on students' own presentation of video material of what they did. Data sources include artifacts produced by students, assessment rubrics and assessment scores. Results indicate that qualitative assessment with criteria negotiated between the instructor/assessor, the twelve learners and their peers over a period of two years, allowed for a 'thick description' of the evaluation experience that adds to student development. Further research needs to be conducted into standardizing the procedures of auditing assessments, rather than standardizing procedures of assessing.

Many courses in this area, for example Multimedia have grown out of many different University departments, either from an Arts, Computer Science and even Engineering Faculty. The challenges of this type of course are numerous and are outlined within this paper, namely how ""Creative Technology"" as a subject area skates the art and technology boundary. Other issues include, how to design and deliver these types of course to students who are very familiar with Web 2.0 tools and now expect a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) as support. This in turn raises issues regarding the balance of e-learning support, face to face and hands on teaching. The term ""Blended Learning"" is now an everyday expression which refers to the combination of virtual and face to face teaching and learning. The teaching of Digital Animation is a worthy example of how computer technology and art come together. This paper describes how diverse and creative subjects such as Animation Concepts can be taught using Blackboard, Podcasts and other on-line learning communities. The need to deliver this in a short period of time to a large number of students is also discussed. Other drivers which influence the delivery of University subjects include increased efficiency in terms of student numbers per module, student staff ratios whilst at the same time improving the student experience and module success rates. This paper will show how creativity and diversity can be embraced and the above challenges met using Blended Learning and the help of student led online learning communities. This paper is relevant because it shows how the latest on-line learning tools and student led learning communities can be used to good effect.

In response, many higher education institutions have adopted a blended learning approach, which combines traditional face-to-face delivery with online teaching resources, to deliver course content. At Victoria University this is now policy and all units offered by the University are required to have an online presence by the first semester of 2009. Our first-year core accounting unit is taught in Australia and overseas locations including Hong Kong, Malaysia and Beijing. There are a number of variations of how this blending occurs and the extent to which it is used may be influenced by a number or factors. These include the technical skills and time allocation of the teaching staff, professional IT support, student motivation, internet speed and access, explicit connection to assessment, and ease of use for assessment tasks. Some of these issues were addressed when this unit was moved to the online learning platform of WebCT. This paper documents the design and implementation of e-assessment and online resources in this introductory accounting unit and monitors its impact on learning outcomes.

Due to growth in enrollment, the class has to accommodate approximately 100 students. To effectively teach CAD in computer classrooms, class sizes need to be limited. In order to provide adequate and efficient instruction to this large number of students, the spring of 2008 course instructor utilized blended learning, an approach that uses a mix of traditional classroom teaching and online training. In this case, the blended learning took the form of computer classroom lectures enhanced with online OnDemand eLearning modules. The class was divided into small lab sections that met every other week. During the bi-weekly meeting, the lab instructor presented interactive lectures on fundamental CAD principles. The classroom enables students to work along with the instructor on a computer. During the time between lectures, the students were given OnDemand eLearning assignments using Bentley Systems, Inc. LEARN Server. Bentley LEARN allows students to access self-paced, OnDemand modules-any time and from any location-that include instruction, demonstrations, and on-line evaluation. These same online courses are utilized by employers around the world to train their employees, so students are learning technology skills prized by future employers. Bentley LEARN also tracks students' progress individually and generates a learning transcript for students reflecting what they complete. By the end of the semester, even though the students had attended only six lab lectures, they were able to complete a full semester's worth of material by utilizing the concept of blended learning. The tracking and evaluation of student progress was facilitated by the use of Bentley's on-line tracking and transcript generation system. Compared to the previous year, when OnDemand eLearning was not utilized, the improvement in student learning and progress was significant. Due to the success of this novel instructional technology, it is being considered for implementation in other classes as well. This paper provides details of the OnDemand eLearning environment, how it was integrated into the Freshman Design course curriculum, and the lessons learned during its implementation.

Our aim in this paper is to demonstrate the contexts and conditions for flexible learning paths that can be tailored to meet individual needs. The concept of this kind of specialised path is to enable learners to individualise the learning process and to adjust it to their personal needs. We will outline the background and provide examples to explain the concept of learning stations which we use in our four courses: Online Marketing, CRM Systems, Business Communications and Event Marketing. This idea of ""freely"" combining subject matter naturally leads to the question of multi-applicability for the learning blocks in various educational contexts. The answers to this question are interesting not only in terms of the feasibility of learning paths from a content and didactic point of view, but also with regard to the economic viability of E-Learning or Blended Learning Systems, which ultimately require technical implementation. In addition we will present some first thoughts on the design of a prototype ""Content Pool"".

This paper mainly focuses on role-taking-based activities, considered from many researchers as useful to support active learning. Many roles can be designed and proposed within learning contexts supporting various skills and psycho-social process; in this paper two roles have been studied: the e-tutor, acting during forum-discussions, and the editor, in charge of supervising a collaborative writing task. A quantitative analysis was conducted to verify the impact of the two roles in terms of: a) participation of the course members to the online activities, b) their preference for one of the roles and c) their perception about the relevance of each role in acquiring academic skills. Forty-nine in-service teachers attending a blended course responded to a 9-items semi-structured questionnaire and their participation has been measured by counting their reading and writing activities. Main results show that no relevant difference in participation score was found between participants performing only the role of editor or that of e-tutor. However, the highest participation is obtained when participants had the possibility to play both roles. Participants prefer one or the other role on the base of specific motivations that we categorize by using theoretical metaphors, from a behavior-ist-based motivation to a socio-constructivist one. Such motivations are differently reported by higher or lower participants showing that the first ones report socio-constructivist argumentations, while the second ones declare a more behaviorist preference. Both roles were perceived as useful for fostering participation and improving communication and collaboration skills. Nevertheless, the role of the editor is perceived as more useful than the e-tutor role in promoting both online and offline participation and individual learning. These results are discussed by highlighting practical implications and suggesting that role-taking activities are as effective on learning as they are perceived familiar and relevant for participants. For this purpose, role-taking activities should be introduced by a specific training",active learners;blended learning;collaborative learning;collaborative writing;e-tutor;participation;role-taking,artificial intelligence;motivation;teaching;active learners;blended learning;collaborative learning;collaborative writing;e-tutor;participation;role-taking;personnel training,"Alvarez, S., Blended learning solutions (2005) Encyclopedia of Educational Technology, , http://coe.sdsu.edu/eet/articles/blendedlearning/start.htm; Blumenfeld, P.C., Marx, R.W., Soloway, E., Krajcik, J., Learning with peers: From small group cooperation to collaborative communities (1996) Educational Research, 25 (8), pp. 37-40; Bonk, C.J., Graham, C.R., (2006) The Handbook of Blended Learning: Global Perspectives, Local Designs, , San Francisco: Pfeiffer Publishing; Brown, A.L., Campione, J.C., Communities of learning or a content by any other name (1990) Contribution to Human Development, pp. 108-126. , Oxford University Press, New York; Clark, R.C., Mayer, R.E., (2007) E-Learning and the Science of Instruction: Proven Guidelines for Consumers and Designers of Multimedia Learning, , CA: Pfeiffer; Dillenbourg, P., What do you mean by collaborative learning?

Both use blended learning approaches and both universities have adopted Blackboard technology. Since 1999, whenever possible, they have linked classes together to discuss ethics cases using e-learning to facilitate the contextual understanding of these qualified nurses working in very different healthcare systems. We originally observed greater resistance to e-learning in the U.K. students and felt it was important to explore this phenomenon further. We were also concerned to ensure that the e-learning element deepened student learning because we identified a risk that the vastness of web-based information available could make student understanding of healthcare ethics inappropriately shallow. The majority of the barriers identified in contemporary literature focus more on extrinsic aspects, such as access to computers and the internet or prior computer experience, internet accessibility, readability of materials and effective facilitation of discussions and few explore person-specific characteristics such as gender, culture or personality type. This paper explains how we have researched student engagement with e-learning from the perspective of intrinsic factors such as personality type and learning style and mapped these against Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Bloom's learning taxonomy. Based on our findings, we have developed strategies which have proved effective in practice. Through further engagement and reflection, we have developed a combined Maslow-Bloom model which now underpins the design of our courses, content delivery and assessment. This paper presents our model and explains how it underpins the educator strategies helping to overcome intrinsic barriers to e-learning by targeted use of intrinsic motivators.

The paper presents an analysis of ePortfolios in use; of the students' process with portfolios; and the teacher's attempts to proactively adjust the plan as the module was running. The analysis dwells on the duality and mutual influence between the ePortfolio and the other activities taking place in the module, both face-to-face and online. Findings revolve around balancing the students' inner and outer motivations with the hurdles they must overcome to begin the ePortfolio; as the cultural issues associated with, what the students, teachers and the educational institutions believes is ""proper"" academic work. In addition, technical issues that influence the communication between the students are highlighted. Here it was found, that particularly the issue of choosing between wiki and blog formats represented two different paradigms for communication about the individual story of the student, but also made an unintended and somewhat surprising difference for the persons interested in looking at the other participants' processes (the timely and historical development of the ePortfolio). All in all, considerations that may turn out to be important for similar setups not only in ePortfolio work. They might also apply for other story telling methodologies and problem oriented project or case work, if the process of and interaction between the students are prioritised. The paper adds to the existing findings within ePortfolio and their application to formal learning settings. It discusses both the planning of and running the process, psychological barriers, students' motivation as well as more technological practical aspects of ePortfolio use, that are relevant for people engaged in IT and learning",e-learning;educational design;it didactical design;portfolio;university teaching,communication;e-learning;motivation;blended learning;cultural issue;educational institutions;educational systems;formal learning;historical development;portfolio;university teaching;students,"Allern, Engelsen, Mapper i digitale læringskontekstar - Erfaringar og perspektiv fra hogre utdanning Noregsuniversitetets Skriftserie Nr. 2/2008, , ISBN nr. 978-82-91308-48-7; Barrett, H., Carney, J., (2005) Conflicting Paradigms and Competing Purposes in Electronic Portfolio Development, pp. 1-14. , http://electronicportfolios.com/portfolios/LEAJournal-BarrettCarney.pdf, retrieved via Helen Barrets blog, unpublished paper retrieved via; Chamber, Wickersham, The electronic portfolio journey: A year later (2007) Education, 00131172, 127 (3), pp. 1-11. , By: Chambers, Sharon M., Wickersham, Leah E.

This is a general-purpose model that combines objectivist and constructivist learning theories and is based on the concept of learning objective. The purpose of the evaluation study is to find out whether the results of using this distance learning instructional model to teach this subject are comparable to learning in a traditional face-to-face classroom, with the plus of eliminating travel and maintenance expenses of the public servants attending the course and also saving time. The learners, selected at random to participate in this study, were divided into three groups depending on the type of teaching/learning they received: traditional classroom, distance learning with virtualized course contents and distance learning based on the proposed instructional model. The results indicate that the grades and satisfaction levels were similar for learners taught using the proposed instructional model and learners taught in the traditional classroom. Moreover, they were substantially better than for distance learning with virtualized contents, although the mean course learning time is greater.

In the United Kingdom, the current debate on the future of Higher Education has produced a vision of online and blended learning supported by a core of open access learning resources available to universities and beyond. Reuse and adaptation (repurposing) of such content is considered to have the potential to support scalable and sustainable diffusion of elearning within and between organisations. Edge Hill University in the North West of England is one of 20 institutions funded by JISC under its Re-purposing & Reuse of Digital University-Level Content and Evaluation (RePRODUCE) programme to test these perceptions in a real-world setting. This exploratory case study reports on the experience of Edge Hill's ReFORM Project and traces the development of an elearning module using teaching content largely constructed from material reused and repurposed from the wider higher education sector. The paper describes how the team approached the module development and analyses the process using a range of evidence obtained from primary sources such as reports and correspondence, reflections of team members, participant observation and learning objects created as a result of the project. The focus of this paper is therefore on processes and people, not specific technologies. Our paper describes the findings that have emerged from a grounded analysis of the data and which have informed our thinking about the longer-term strategies necessary to diffuse wide-scale reuse of digital teaching content within our university. Our own experience suggests that widespread use and repurposing of digital content is dependent upon an emerging digital content literacy to inform a process of deliberate planning for reuse at the initial design stage. It also suggests that curriculum design using digital content requires a rethinking of traditional roles and a broad acceptance of new approaches using non-hierarchical, multi-professional teams who can accept a blurring of roles and embrace the 'messiness' and iterative process",digital content;digital content literacy;multi-professional teams;repurposing;reusable learning objects;reuse,curricula;societies and institutions;digital contents;multi-professional teams;repurposing;reusable learning object;reuse;e-learning,"Bassey, M., (1999) Case Study Research in Educational Settings, , Maidenhead: Open University Press; Charmaz, K., Mitchell, R.G., Grounded theory in ethnography (2001) Handbook of Ethnography, , Atkinson et al.

The wealth of language learning materials and activities available on the web gives English language teachers and learners access to a variety of language learning resources. While online newspapers, magazines, films, discussion boards, and blogs provide authentic material for language learning, a wide range of language skills can be enhanced with the use of web-based exercises and activities from vocabulary practice, grammar lessons, reading and writing tasks to listening and pronunciation exercises. All exercises and activities can be created either by the teachers themselves or, when it comes to using open resources, used freely and be tailored to suit the specific needs of their technical students. Online learning environments can not only increase interaction among students with web-based communication tools that permit group work that would be difficult to arrange if students had to meet in the same physical location at the same time, they also foster and promote self-directed learning and provide technical part-time students with the opportunity to actively pursue areas of personal need and/or interest. Creating student-specific learning paths in a supportive web-based environment is one powerful tool to support a student's learning efforts and goals. However, the World Wide Web's capability for interactivity makes it particularly exciting as a resource for collaborative language teaching and learning. Examples of such interactive learning environments include online discussion boards which can increase both student-student and student-teacher discussion and help develop language, critical thinking and social interaction skills, as well as online workspaces which allow working on, presenting and discussing the results of web-based collaborative learning activities such as simulations, web-quests, and case studies. Besides depicting some ways to promote self-directed and collaborative language learning, this paper partly also focuses on English language needs assessment and learner-centred evaluation approaches in technical part-time studies",blended learning;collaborative activities;language learning;learner assessment;self-directed approaches;technical part-time studies,computer aided instruction;learning systems;social networking (online);teaching;world wide web;blended learning;collaborative activities;language learning;learner assessment;self-directed;technical part-time studies;students,"Garrison, D.R., Vaughan, N.D., (2008) Blended Learning in Higher Education.

This context had long begged for the creation of innovative learning spaces and adoption of engaging pedagogies. Recourse to technology support and experimenting with the WIKI as a learning tool at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria gave us an insight into the benefits and challenges of the set-up and use of new knowledge technologies in our technology-poor context. This paper reports an experiment in an extra-large (XXL) class of freshmen (2000+) on a module of second language project writing using the WIKI. The paper emphasises the unique advantages of the WIKI in a large blended learning class and the affordances for socio-cultural and collaborative learning experience. In creating new learning teams and forging collaboration among learners leveraging one another's abilities, the wiki experience extended the 'classroom' beyond the physical space, engaged students in interactional communication in the second language, encouraged negotiation of meaning, and challenged learners in finding their 'solutions' to real life problems around them, aside from acquisition of hands-on digital literacy. The paper reports on how learners experience and participate in learning on a technology supported module. Data for the investigation and evaluation of students' learning experiences were collected using teacher observation of team formation and collaboration on activities offline and tracked students' logs, footprints and activities on group pages online; students' feedback on the end-of-course learners evaluation forms; and their reflections as gleaned from their comments, encouraged and freely made continually by many from inception through to the end of the course, on the front page of our wiki. The report employs both qualitative and quantitative parameters. Results indicated a large number of students would like more of their courses supported by technology and thought the medium offered hope for the future, as it opened up new vistas in their learning.

Yet further consideration should be given to flexible and accessible means for meeting the growing request for continuous learning. Jason Hughes describes an organization's capability to learn to learn as a fundamental change in the outlook towards learning, not only by providing training for short-term skill gaps, but by engaging in an ongoing approach for the development of learning opportunities which encourage innovation and enable a more proactive outlook by organizations (Hughes 2000). Sustainable support for educational development using new technologies in education depends on having a basic roadmap that links current demands for developmental support to a plan for ways in which longer term needs will be recognized and met. The growing demand for continued learning of a second language is evident within the workplace where new technologies offer flexible solutions. In order to meet the special needs of professional adults the University of Siena Language Center (CLA) has developed a multiple-level series of blended English courses from beginner to intermediate levels for life-long learners including the hospital staff of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese (AOUS), the employees of a local bank and university technical-administrative personnel. The pedagogical approach takes into consideration both the needs of adults who are working full-time and the aims of the curriculum, which are to develop the four linguistic abilities of reading, writing, listening and speaking up to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) Level B1. Taking into consideration a constructive use of both teaching hours, classrooms and, above all, the limited time available to adult learners, a blended approach was chosen. This paper will present conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the blending approach for continuous learning of a second language (L2) by adult learners. Through a primarily qualitative analysis of formative and summative course evaluation data we illustrate that communicative language learning online in collaborative activities fosters improvement in second-language writing and reading comprehension skills, while face-to-face (f2f) lessons were found to be useful for the development of conversation and listening comprehension. This paper also demonstrates that online collaborative learning activities in English for specific purposes (ESP) stimulate increased motivation and provide a flexible context for language learning which adults view as a definite advantage for structuring study time when and where it is most convenient",blended learning;cmc;connectedness;continuous learning;second language,blending;curricula;societies and institutions;teaching;blended learning;cmc;connectedness;continuous learning;second language;personnel training,"Aljaafreh, A., Lantolf, J.P., Negative feedback as regulation and second language learning in the zone of proximal development (1994) Modern Language Journal, 78, pp. 465-483; Beaty, E., Hodgson, V., Mann, S., McDonnell, D., Working towards E-quality in networked E-learning in higher education: A manifesto statement for debate (2002) Dissemination Event for Understanding the Implications of Networked Learning for Higher Education Seminar Series, , presented at a University of Sheffield, Sheffield; Chapelle, C., Computer applications in second language acquisition: Foundations for teaching (2001) Testing and Research, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Chapelle, C., (2003) English Language Learning and Technology, Lectures on Applied Linguistics in the Age of Information and Communication Technology, , John Benjamins Pub.

This paper presents a case study of an initial teacher programme where a commitment to providing more interactivity, ensuring media richness and to personalising the learning experience for students led to a reconceptualisation of the delivery and a move to a blended learning approach. The nature of teacher education is explored and considered alongside the potential of blended learning and the question asked: Can an initial teacher education programme be redesigned in a way that realises the potential of blended learning? In attempting to answer this question design, development and implementation issues are explored and the responses to them outlined.

In addition, the professional world asks the University to provide formative opportunities that train students to fulfill their roles as working professionals. In order to respond to these requirements, the University of Navarra has offered, for more than 10 years, an open-elective course entitled ""Formation in Professional Skills (I and II)"". The objective of this course is to collaborate in the formation of university students in those skills which are particularly valued by businesses. In this paper, we will explain the content of this course, in particular its structure, methodology and evaluation parameters, along with the role of the professor-tutor.

However, the concept of intensive learning, for example immediately prior to an exam, is only supported to a minor degree, if at all; thus, a recapitulation of learning content often still takes place in a traditional way where digital content is printed on paper and then annotated with highlighters and post-its, for example. The Learnr Web platform under development at the University of Munster bridges this gap within the process of technology enhanced learning by adopting well-known learning paradigms to the digital world. Following a community-driven, Web 2.0-coined approach, on the one side structures representing the learners' language, collaboratively created summaries and file cards arise; at a social level bottom-up networking and learning communities are fostered through sharing of individually created material",collaborative e-learning;learning communities;social software;web 2.0,blended learning;collaborative e-learning;digital contents;digital worlds;digital-learning;electronic platforms;learning communities;learning contents;learning paradigms;side structures;social software;technology-enhanced learning;web 2.0;e-learning;multimedia systems;world wide web;education,"Bersin, J., The Blended Learning Handbook: Best Practices, Proven Methodologies, and Lessons Learned (2004) Pfeiffer Wiley; Grob, H.L., Bensberg, F., Dewanto, L., (1999) Das cHL-Redaktionssystem InterUSS, , ERCIS Working Paper No. 14, Muenster; Husemann, B., Lechtenborger, J., Vossen, G., Westerkamp, P.: XLX - A Platform for Graduate-Level Exercises.

It provides a systematic and organized access to the plethora of free social software available online for the development of collaborative learning activities. The goal of this particular BLC professional development activity was to offer a face-to-face group of English teachers in Venezuela the opportunity to meet members of an international community of practice (CoP) and together review a packaged learning course material online. Blended technology, the mix and match of available tools, served to display the wide use of resources and each person's skills. By exploring online tools, participants gained an opportunity for learning about both educational theory and the use of technology. The experience described here shows a prototype of future pathways towards educational content use and development.

The content of this course was to teach the main aspects of e-learning like the didactical and historical background, e-learning technologies and strategies, multimedia and authoring software typically used to produce e-learning applications, the use of a learning platform offering downloads, communication, collaboration, web based training (WBT), online testing etc. We think, the best way of teaching e-learning means to use e-learning methods in combination with the well established concept of conventional presence lecturing using Powerpoints or a whiteboard. Together with computer based training (CBT) for homework, our course should be a good example for the blended learning concept, not only enriching but also integrating many elearning concepts. This paper sketches the curriculum, arrangement, and findings of our course.

In seeking a greater degree of integration between physical and virtual learning spaces we have been keen to explore how digital audio can be used to engage and develop students. Digital audio has shown itself to be a simple media with which to work and a simple media to distribute. Its essential value has proven to be in how it supports access to the disparate voices available to education and we have developed several ideas. These include Audio Notes to support lectures, educational podcasting and audio feedback to bridge the virtual and physical environments towards offering a more meaningful, richer, and formative learning experience. Our recent work has proven that digital audio is generally accessible to, and valued by students, and that it can lead to greater ongoing engagement in the module. This paper focuses on the formative feed forward potential of this flexible media and illustrates how we have built upon initial successes by improving the design and integration of audio feedback. It describes how the techniques have been used to promote an holistic blended learning environment and how this has affected both the student and the tutor",,blended approach;blended learning;curriculum designs;digital audio;educational podcasting;feed forward;learning environments;learning experiences;physical environments;virtual learning;blending;curricula;engineering education;software engineering;students;computer aided instruction,"Bradley, S., Middleton, A., Nunnington, N., Media interventions: Designing video and audio to stimulate learning activity (2006) Proceedings of DIVERSE (Developing Innovative Video Resources for Students Everywhere) Conference: Enriching Elearning Using Video and Multimedia (Both Facetoface and at A Distance), , Glasgow, 2006; Chickering, A., Ehrmann, S.C., Implementing the seven principles: Technology as lever (1996) AAHE Bulletin, pp. 3-6. , http://www.tltgroup.org/programs/seven.html, October, last accessed: 7/1/2008; Cooper, N.J., Facilitating learning from formative feedback in Level 3 assessment (2000) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 25 (3), pp. 279-291; Fidler, A., Middleton, A., Nortcliffe, A., Providing added value to lecture materials to an iPod generation (2006) 6th Conference of the International Consortium for Educational Development, , Sheffield, UK; Johanson, R., Rethinking the red ink: Audiofeedback in the ESL writing classroom (1999) Texas Papers in Foreign Language Education, 4 (1), pp. 31-38; Kelly, P., Ryan, S., Using tutor tapes to support the distance learner (1983) International Council for Distance Education Bulletin, 3, pp. 1-18; Kirschner, P.A., Van Den Brink, H., Meester, M., Audiotape feedback for essays in distance education (1991) Innovative Higher Education, 15 (2). , Spring/Summer; Law, E., Promoting understanding using a virtual learning environment (2005) International Conference on Engineering Education, 1, pp. 806-811. , Gliwice, Poland; Laurillard, D., (2002) Understanding University Teaching, , 2nd ed (London, Routledge); Mentzer, G., Cryan, J., Teclehaimanot, B., Two peas in a pod? a comparison of facetoface and web based classrooms (2007) Journal of Technology and Teacher Education, 15 (2), pp. 233-246; Middleton, A., Nortcliffe, A.L., Understanding effective models of audio feedback (2008) Engineering Education, , Ed Rajarshi Roy (ed.), (forthcoming); Moore, G.E., Individualizing instructional feedback: A comparison of feedback modes in university classes (1977) Annual International Conference for Individualized Instruction, , Paper presented at the, West Lafayette, Indiana, November 7; Nortcliffe, A.L., Featherstone, S., Garrick, R., Swift, G., Supplemental instruction a higher level learning?

It takes into account the models offered by flexible lifelong learning as the proper way to develop training for teachers in service, considering the advantages of blended learning for the target audience. The chapter discusses the balance between mere ICT skills and pedagogical competences. In this context the learning design should always allow that the teachers in training integrate in their work ICT solutions that fit to the didactic objectives, renew teaching and learning methodology, facilitate communication, give place to creativity, and allow pupils to learn at their own pace. By doing so, they will be closer to the profile of a tutor online, as a practitioner who successfully takes advantages of the virtual environments for collaborative work and learning communication.

We intend to promote e-learning technologies in medical, pharmaceutical and health care domains. Our approach to e-learning is so called blended learning, which combines traditional face-to-face and Web-based on-line learning, with focus on principles of active learning. Using Java and XML technologies, we build models for various categories of wounds, due to various aetiologies. Based on colour and texture analysis, we identify the main barriers to wound healing, such as tissue non-viable, infection, inflammation, moisture imbalance, or edge non-advancing. This framework provides the infrastructure for preparing e-learning scenarios based on practice and real world experiences. We make experiments for wound healing simulation using various treatments and compare the results with experimental observations. Our experiments are supported by XML based databases containing knowledge extracted from previous wound healing experiences and from medical experts knowledge. Also, we rely on new paradigms of the Artificial Intelligence for creating e-learning scenarios to be used in a context of active learning, for wound image understanding.

The aim of this paper was to see how students used the Internet group in the learning of literature so that the effect of the use of an Internet group on learning literature can be discussed. In this study, content analysis was used to understand the nature of the activity situated in the Internet group. The results of the analysis of the Internet group suggest that the Internet group was mainly used by the course takers for formal interaction. It is seen that very little collaboration or real interaction took place amongst the course takers towards creating meaning together. The results support the view that using technology in literature learning has advantages mainly because the students were interested in working in this group although they were nether graded in the activity nor were mandated to take part in it",blended learning;internet;internet group;literature,,"Arikan, A., An evaluation of literature curriculum in H.U.

We have specified different types of learning materials, made experiments with the learning materials, and even prepare the guidelines for the development of the e-learning materials. Initial hopes that elearning materials would free the teachers from their noncreative work have vanished. The production requires time and knowledge far beyond the average teacher. Elearning became blended-learning, v-learning and mlearning, and it merely provides supplement to the traditional educational processes. Consequently, too many so called ""elearning"" materials are below the quality of past years textbooks. The transitions of educational institutions to the e-learning were led by enthusiasts who produced high quality learning material. To produce the large quantity of e-learning material the support teams are needed. The support teams need producers, equipment, and primarily budget. Since there are limited funds the progress becomes slow and in some cases it even stops. In the article we present the evolution of the e-learning materials in the Slovenian educational institutions for education of teachers and the prediction of the future. In our research we include three faculties from the University of Maribor and one from the University of Ljubljana.

We believe that if students feel that they fit in the group, their commitment will be higher and their results will be better. In introductory programming courses, most tasks are elementary and are usually performed on an individual basis. If we manage to give greater visibility to those lonely activities, students will find out that the difficulties they face are shared by many, and realize that they are not alone. We do that by adding a competitive flavour to the tasks in the course. For example, programming assignments are modelled after programming competitions; quizzes are given after each lecture, students get points for it, and a ranking is kept, much like those in some sports; we organize tournaments, where students' programs play against one another in a computer game. This provides a supplement of excitement to tasks that otherwise might be uninteresting to newcomers, and fosters group spirit. As a consequence, student participation is higher and results were better than before",automatic judging systems;blended-learning;competition-based learning;web-enhancement,competition;e-learning;education;information systems;internet;mergers and acquisitions;multimedia systems;students;world wide web;automatic judging systems;blended-learning;computer games;introductory programming courses;programming assignments;spi-rit;student participations;teaching programmings;web-enhancement;unmanned aerial vehicles (uav),"Computing Curricula (2001) Computer Science Volume, , http://www.sigcse.org/cc2001, ACM/IEEE, Available; Cutler, R.H., 1995.

To this end, an effective teaching approach relies on a blended-learning strategy that combines face-to-face lessons with students' practice on some suitable educational tool. Such a tool should support students through the whole learning process, and help them to improve their modelling ability along with their programming expertise. In this paper we describe S-vLab, a virtual laboratory for supporting teaching and learning in several applicative domains; in particular, we analyse S-vLab applied to the Information Security field. In this context, one of its main goals is to help students in dealing with the Java Security Platform, supporting different learning styles and allowing multiple formative paths. Using S-vLab students can, in various steps, model a secure system, simulate its behaviour and evaluate its performance, and finally build and test a software prototype by leveraging numerous facilities. These include the provision of extracts of sample Java code, the availability of supporting resources and a continuous and immediate feedback, aimed at pointing out possible errors and suggesting solutions. After describing more in detail the features provided by S-vLab, as well as how the depicted functionalities can help in achieving the settled learning goals, we refer on the results obtained in an experimentation of the virtual lab during a course on Information Security with about 150 students.

This article describes the rationale and processes behind the development of a teaching and learning design that utilised web-based activities with face-to-face teaching and role-play sessions. The purpose underlying the design is to prepare students with the appropriate knowledge of legislation and policies as well as providing learning opportunities to gain the skills required to operate as critically reflective practitioners in the complex world of child protection. A social constructivist theoretical perspective governing the teaching design is outlined with the student evaluation of their learning experiences.

Just as broad as the field of ICT itself, IT Security is an integral part of all network and software applications. Security must be guaranteed throughout services. Too often, a single university or department cannot offer the complete range of IT Security subjects to their students or provide the up-to-date information and knowledge needed. Consequently, the demand of keeping up with hackers, threats, and risks is hardly met. Our proposal is a combination of the know-how of multiple institutions, aligned in an Intensive Programme for Master- and PhD Students of Computer Science, Information Systems, and Business Informatics. The proposed Intensive Programme on Information and Communication Security (IPICS) uses e-learning and traditional learning methods to form a blended learning course. Using the synergies of 19 contracted European Universities and their IT Security experts, IPICS will deliver momentum for IT Security education and training to those who take part and furthermore through their networks.

With the primary aim to improving the practice of teaching and learning of computer programming, we have developed a web-based automated system, known as PASS, for use in our courses. Since its first introduction a few years ago, PASS has proved to be a valuable tool for both students and instructors. PASS has now undergone significant revisions, with enhanced capabilities that have created opportunities for new pedagogy and innovative strategies for both teaching and learning. This paper describes the functionalities, design and implementation of PASS, how it can be used to enhance students' interest of learning and monitor their progress, and illustrates several approaches with which PASS can facilitate blended learning of good practices in computer programming.

Cronbach' alpha, item analysis and item discrimination indices, principal component analysis, varimax rotation, and discriminant validity were used to measure the reliability and validity of the scale. A 50-item refined version of the scale was found to be highly reliable and of reasonable length. Further refinement was made based on principal component analysis. This indicated two major components, which facilitate the elicitation of learners' views on blended learning and its implementation process in relation to the complexity levels of the learning process. The scale is recommended to identify individual's views on blended learning and its implementation process and thus, to contribute to the improvement of a blended learning environment for learners.

Methopedia is one activity within the EU-funded multilateral ICT project ""Community of Integrated Blended Learning in Europe"" (COMBLE), which is composed of partners from business, university and education. Methopedia is envisioned to be a community based wiki-system, combined with social networking features, where trainers and teachers from various sectors (vocational training, enterprises, universities, and public bodies) can consult, discuss, describe and share blended learning methods and methodologies. The aim of the COMBLE project and Methopedia is to contribute to leveraging the quality of education and training in Europe by engaging practitioners and researchers in developing, sharing and promoting innovative blended learning concepts and methods. To enable practitioners to share methods and learning designs an important task is to construct a shared, flexible pedagogical model/template for describing these. The model, which we outline in this paper, through discussing and synthesising literature within the field of learning design, needs to be further developed through theoretical and conceptual discussions. However, based on existing research, we argue that it is necessary that the model is developed through engaging the partner-network of trainers from business and education, and position them as co-creators of models and frameworks. We conclude the paper by discussing and outlining requirements and functionalities, some of which follow from the discussion of learning designs and blended learning, while others are related to the technical and socio-technical aspects of Methopedia",blended learning methods;community based wiki;learning activities;learning designs;methopedia;sharing best practices,e-learning;learning systems;personnel training;teaching;best practices;blended learning;community-based;learning activity;learning designs;methopedia;design,"Baym, N., The new shape of online community: The example of Swedish independent music fandom (2007) First Monday, 12 (8). , http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1978/1853, viewed 25 March 2008; Berge, O., Reuse of Digital Learning Resources in Collaborative Learning Environments (2006), University of Oslo, Oslo; Bersin, J., The blended learning book: best practices (2004) proven methodologies, and lessons learned, , San Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer; Britain, S., A Review of Learning Design: Concept, Specifications and Tools (2004) A report for the JISC E-learning Pedagogy Programme, JISC, , http://jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/elearningpedagogy/learningdesigntoolsfinalreport.pdf, viewed 6 July 2008; Cavanagh, A., Sociology in the Age of the Internet (2007), Open University Press, Berkshire, England; Conole, G., Cross, S., Brasher, A., Weller, M., Nixon, S., Clark, P., A learning design methodology to foster and support creativity in design (2008) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Networked Learning, pp. 46-53. , V.

There are many studies taking place across the sector in the development and deployment of podcasts, one wide ranging and beneficial study is the IMPALA project based at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom. This paper will focus on the concept of using a series of vodcasts as an 'educational metronome' to pace students' engagement with their studies. This initial study is based on a cohort of twenty-three post-graduate students , nine male and fourteen female, of a variety of ages and experience (although all have been involved professionally in education for at least four years) undertaking a technology-enhanced Learning continual professional development (CPD) programme which leads to a M.Sc. technology-enhanced Learning qualification. The course is delivered in a blended-Learning mode with each of the three modules per year having three faceto- face sessions of three hours spread over a twelve week period inter-woven with on-line self-directed individual and group work. The participants are all experienced educational professionals in the Higher Education and Further Education sector from the region. They range from novice adopters of technology in their pedagogy with a desire to develop their capabilities in technology-enhanced Learning to more advanced practitioners wishing to use their expertise more efficiently and gain underpinning knowledge and understanding of the subject. The range of disciplines that the participants cover is a broad selection of the sector's teaching areas. One of the outcomes is to create a 'good enough' approach (both in the vodcasts' production quality and resources, e.g. time, hardware and software, cost of the vodcasts) to developing podcasts and vodcasts that can be adopted within a range of disciplines, by educators with a wide variety of experience and be embedded transparently into the normal pedagogy of educators. The study endeavours to explore the use of vodcasts to enter the 'learning window' of the students and positively affect the pace of application to specific topic learning thereby improving both the students' attainment and the students' learning experience",learning metronome;podcasts;technology-enhanced learning;vodcasts;web 2.0;window into learning,e-learning;students;teaching;technology;learning metronome;podcasts;technology enhanced learning;vodcasts;web 2.0;engineering education,"Denscombe, M., The good research guide for small-scale social research projects, 2nd ed (2003), Maidenhead, Open University; Harland, T., Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and problem-based learning: linking a theoretical concept with practice through action research (2003) Teaching in Higher Education, 8 (2), pp. 263-272; Hwang, W.Y., Shiu, R.L., Li, C.C., An Exploration of the Timing of Asynchronous Learning (2001) Proceedings of the National Science Council ROC(D), 3, pp. 126-135; Jones, R.E.J., Cooke, L., A Window into Learning: Case Studies of Online Group Communication and Collaboration (2006) Alt-J: Research in Learning Technology, 14 (3), pp. 261-274; Kolb, D., Experiential Learning (1984), Prentice Hall, London; Lim, D.H., The Effect of Flexible Learning Schedule on Online Learners' Learning (2004) Application and Instructional Perception, pp. 1060-1066. , Online Submission, Paper presented at the Academy of Human Resource Development International Conference (AHRD) (Austin, TX, March 3-7, 2004), Symp. 49-1); Meng, P., an unpublished white paper: Podcasting and Vodcasting - Definitions (2005) Discussions and Implications, , University of Missouri IAT Services; Moule, P., Challenging the five-stage model for e-learning: a new approach (2007) ALT-J Research in Learning Technology, 15 (1), pp. 37-50; ALT-J Research in Learning Technology, 15 (2), pp. 171-180; Salmon, G., E-moderating: the key to teaching and learning online (2003), RoutledgeFalmer, London; Salmon, G., E-moderating: the key to teaching and learning online (2nd ed.)

These services have been provided for the Department of Philosophy and Humanities at Freie Universitat Berlin (FUB), Germany, within the framework of the project ""FU e-Learning"" (FUeL) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The focus of the project, and of this paper, is on solutions to integrating e-Learning and face-to-face teaching that can be realized with manageable time and effort. This paper states, based on empirical findings, that the basic application of e-Learning (in the sense of limiting it to online distribution of information and material) is firmly anchored in university teaching in the Humanities. However, more complex scenarios that entail not only administrative but also pedagogical benefits are not yet part of everyday teaching in the Humanities. This paper analyses the reasons for the below average implementation, and proposes a number of measures to overcome this situation. These measures include, among others, propagating prototypical scenarios and best practice examples, proposing didactic models for e- Learning suitable to university teaching, improving the lecturerse-competence by offering training and consulting services, and introducing concepts and tools of e-Learning 2.0. The effectiveness of these measures is illustrated in two ways: First, by means of the results of evaluation activities accompanying a project on developing and testing complex e-Learning scenarios for the Humanities, where within six months after the implementation of the measures, the quantity and - most notably - the quality of e-Learning usage at the institute increased considerably.

Expertise in musicianship, however, is not determined solely from academic credentials and the integration of tangible knowledge objects, but also through the assimilation of often intangible elements of interpretative performance. In a continuing study supporting the development of an online piano pedagogy program, research is being undertaken to determine appropriate learning objects for coaching piano teachers in the cognitive and pedagogical skills required to teach musicianship to beginning piano students. Basic aural skills and theoretical knowledge are just the start to understanding how to interpret music: learning how to express musical style through actual performance requires a multi-faceted approach that of necessity involves an experienced mentor. Founded on principles of Bloom's Taxonomy and integrated instructional design, the process of 'teaching teachers to teach' models the steps required to transmit musicianship skills to beginning students themselves, through affective, psychomotor and cognitive domains. In this short paper the authors present findings of research and experiential knowledge of pedagogy on methods for teaching musicianship skills in a blended learning, online format",blended learning;e-learning;e-pedagogy;multimedia;music pedagogy,blended learning;e-pedagogy;experiential knowledge;integrated instructional designs;learning objects;multi-faceted approach;multimedia;music pedagogy;musical instruments;students;teaching;e-learning,"Perelman, N., (1994) Autumn Leaves, , Translated by Henry Orlov.

In this paper we present Amalgamated Learning framework, a branch of Blended learning which focuses on collaborative learning students beginning their learning from Face-to-Face classroom and extend their learning onto the web to close the communication gap. Our framework focuses on (i) Students and teacher: - Through students' progress navigation window; (ii) Students and the learning contents: - with the support of Content Assessment Tracker; and (iii) Collaboration among students: - through the use of student log data and reward mechanism. We see amalgamated learning as a double-edge sword which is capable of giving students both F2F and Online learning experiences. This framework enhances the students' communication, bargaining and collaboration skills among their peers and between them and their teachers to achieve their learning goals.

The model called the Spring-Cycle Blended Curriculum (SCBC) Model combines the strengths of two learning pedagogies namely blended learning and scaffolding for the design of a new curriculum. The initial simplified version of the curriculum was piloted for the module HW001, English Proficiency at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in January 2007. It was found that the model was effective in achieving the target learning outcomes for students within shorter contact hours with the tutor. The model is currently being implemented and evaluated on a full-scale for HW001. Survey findings from the earlier pilot showed that students both enjoyed and benefitted from the new model. The study by Thanasingam and Soong (2007) on the online oral skills activity used in the model also supports this. One implication of the success of this model is its potential of being adapted and customized for other learning contexts both in and beyond Singapore.

Diagonal 645, 08028 Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain","This paper shows a new method for using Wikis, forums, and other web-based productivity tools in blended learning strategies [20][22] to promote the acquisition of competences in Higher education [4] while enhancing experiential learning of students [16] in social collaborative knowledge building scenarios. This methodology also facilitated the grading of student individual contributions in cooperative work, helping to detect any shortcomings that may prevent student active involvement in their learning process, allowing to conduct not only product evaluation but also process evaluation. Based upon previous successful experiences, the free, on-line software platform, TikiWiki CMS/Groupware, was selected to achieve this methodology. [5][6][10][11]. Students had to think about 'What's the 'type of contribution' that I'm going to make right now?' before submitting new contributions in forums, comments, or document editions (either text or spreadsheet based). Each student's contribution type and size (in bytes) was stored in a log on the website, and could be queried, filtered, and exported for further analyses. The method was tested on an Environmental Sciences course, and its strengths and weaknesses are discussed in the paper. The method description includes a suggested process to convert student contributions (type and size) into numerical grades. However, the main potential of this method is not just final assessment for student accreditation, but serving data for tutorships with students along the process of the learning activities, in order to detect and revert whatever handicaps that prevented some students improving their contributions to the group work or cooperative learning 'in time' (much prior to assignment submission to teacher). This preliminary study resulted in a three-times greater time investment by teachers. Further data needs to be collected to better estimate the true costs of this new method.

No doubt such works have contributed tremendously to the reusing and sharing of useful learning designs and improve their transferability to other similar contexts. However, even though such high or medium-level descriptions of learning designs provide useful guidelines and models for practitioners to source and reapply into their unique contexts, decisions of which designs to employ, for what kinds of learner, and in which educational contexts remain complex design decisions to make for practitioners everyday. The appearance of learning technologists in many higher education institutions with the aim to assist the teaching staff in learning design may ease some of the contextualisation and localisation issues, especially for a fully online course, but in blended-learning environments, the face-to-face classroom contexts are inaccessible to anyone but the teaching staff themselves. Thus there is a need to explore and document the common considerations made by such practitioners teaching in a blended mode and the design constraints for them. The paper intends to documents the experiential knowledge of design by the practitioner at such ground level.

The aim of the interviews was to identify attitudes towards the implementation of e-Government and competencedevelopment needs. The respondents were very aware of social aspects of e-Government. The implementation of e-Government meansa cultural change of attitudes, knowledge and competence for the personnel. Different perspectives from users and providers could be reasons behind neglecting social aspects. The respondents requested a bottom-up strategy of the implementation work. Participation of users in project work and thorough analysis of work culture, work routines before implementation could make focus of implementation work more relevant and make the implementation to a learning process for the users and increase their motivation. A web-based study circle focussing on e-Government was developed and implemented in the organisation, as a consequence of the results from the interview study. A study circle could be one way of competence development stimulate development-oriented learning by the personnel (compared with adaptive learning).

Information and communication technologies have impacted by providing a means of access to digital resources and interactive communication for all courses and the blending of pedagogy and technology has produced a range of approaches to teaching and learning. This paper discusses the research literature and the writers' research, defining what they have concluded are teaching practices that use the concept of blended learning effectively. In investigating how ICT can add variation for student learning, they analyze this from two dominant modes of pedagogy, learning environment and pedagogy through both on-campus and distance education. In both modes, students acknowledged the power and effectiveness of blended learning.

In spite of this advantage, university teachers often find it difficult to adopt new online techniques, in part because institutional practices are still geared to support more traditional approaches. This paper describes how a project, funded to support international collaboration to enhance learning and teaching in Geography, has allowed a university to explore models for change. It briefly examines the associated issues of sharing and repurposing resources; it reflects on the impact of the project on local strategy, and the importance of sustaining the collaborations and approaches to learning and teaching after the funding is completed.

This contribution looks at both the impact of the experience on the results of students who enrolled the module at the beginning of the initiative in 2003, and the level of satisfaction of the students who attended the course three years after its start. In particular, part of the work is devoted to the national project which allowed the start of the module itself. The project (a Prin project - Project of National Relevant Interest) was actually funded by the Government and aimed at defining the role of e-learning within higher education environments. It was carried out by eight different research units located all over the country. In the above framework, the Roma Tre University, has developed its own research carrying out an experimental programme at the module of Educational Research - Faculty of Primary Education. The experiment, which began thanks to the initial contribution of the Ministry, is now in its third year and, as it is described in the full paper, meets various needs frequently put forward by the students. It also demonstrates that fieldwork, given the geographical and procedural complexity of education, can contribute effectively to the improvement of the quality of university teaching",blended learning;elearaing;evaluation;higher education;interaction;quality;teaching,,"Duffy, T.M., Jonassen, D.H., (1992) Constructivism and the Technology of Instruction: A Conversation, , Hillsdale, New Jersey, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers; Vertecchi, B., (1993) Decisione Didattica e Valutazione, , Firenze, La Nuova Italia; Wenger, E., (1998) Communities of Practice.

Blending of online learning with classroom sessions offers the potential to use a virtual learning environment to deliver learning activities, and to support learners using a distance learning model. Online tracking can also help to target 'at risk' learners quickly. In an action research project to improve retention, a blended module with proactive tutor support was compared with a previous cohort of the module and with similar classroom-only modules where there was no focus on learner support. Learners were also interviewed and the tutor kept records of the learner contact time. The resulting improved coursework submission rate was attributed to learner motivation as a result of peer and tutor support. The total teaching time was no greater in this model, although the workload distribution changed, and the tutor needed to be highly skilled in e-learning",,,"Bligh, D., What's the use of lectures?

Increasingly teachers in Geography have leveraged the potentials of the Web and of Internet communications, excellent examples can be found at www.HERODOT.net. Distance Learning clearly demonstrates that successful learning takes place in social settings. Outside of traditional classrooms students are frequently challenged by the lack of a social fabric directly supporting their study environment. Successful online courses attempt to re-create this social context through various types on Internet-based interaction: synchronous and asynchronous communication, threaded discussion forums, live streaming presentations and working groups meeting in virtual classrooms. The recent emergence of what is widely termed ""Web 2.0"" has moved the online framework for Digital Learning to a new level. Available Internet communication models have become more interactive, more participative and much more dynamic. The Web is developing from a one-way information delivery mechanism into a highly interactive platform correspoding to the social dynamics of a virtual society. Teachers now have the opportunity to transform online students from mere readers and listeners into active learners, teachers can fully apply constructivist concepts in virtual classrooms. Students us weblogs, wikis and other platforms where knowledge can be built from participants' contributions and ideas emerge from critical discussions. Using these types of social software in virtual classrooms generates novel challenges for educators and students alike. While most current principles of education theory translate well into interactive online environments, teachers are challenged to adequately set up and manage a multi-level learning process in a highly distributed environment. Geographic Learning stands to benefit very substantially from interactive online learning. Already platforms like Google Earth and other virtual globes when hyperlinked with social web tools provide a learning experience which takes education to a new level. New challenges emerge from virtual worlds like Second Life: learning about geographic concepts in a parallel world where Real Life individuals explore and build a fictitious environment in order to translate this experience into the much more volatile and certainly more important real world is a concept holding lots of potential for Geography education. As much as Geography is about facts, issues, problems and conflicts in our real world, we now have the opportunity to leverage the potential of virtual worlds, the promise of online interaction frameworks for creating new social contexts, and the opportunities created by participative tools to improve our understanding of Real World Geography",,education;learning;software;teaching;virtual reality;world wide web,"Alexander, B., Web 2.0: A New Wave of Innovation for Teaching and Learning?

Amongst other efforts co-workers of IWB have created a set of virtual content concerning concrete technology within a German e-teaching network in civil engineering materials science called ""WiBA-Net"" ( http://www.wiba-net.de ). The content of this network consists of teaching material that is organized at four different levels of granularity. At the most basic level single items (""assets"") are collected. At the second level such assets are arranged into single pages filling one screen. Several pages dealing with aspects of a single topic are ordered into a teaching path at the third level and finally a set of teaching paths forms an entire course at level four. Virtual searching methods are offered on all four levels depending on the state of the user. Besides the mentioned teaching material also virtual communication facilities are offered within the network. During the work on WiBA-Net, which consists of six German Universities, questions concerning the reusability of virtual content, metadata enhancement techniques and the concept of Blended Learning were focused. Educational and didactic aspects have been closely taken into account and quality assuring evaluation methods have been applied. Meanwhile first experiences have been made in real life teaching and learning situations, which give us an idea of future needs and development in the field.

Two cohorts of students were presented with the same material in lecture format. The control group attended a traditional live lecture, while the treatment group was offered an e-lecture with the same content. Both groups were asked to work on specific review questions and encouraged to pose their own, as preparation for a knowledge-acquisition post-test. There were no significant differences in post-intervention measures regarding students' level of knowledge, but students in the e-lecture group (lacking immediate teacher-student communication) employed a strongly acquisitive mode of learning, thus undermining teacher-student dialogue later in classroom. The results of this study indicate that students may learn efficiently at the introductory level by using e-lecturing material and they are also satisfied by the flexibility of the experience. However, the adoption of e-lectures to support flexible learning should be explored in close relationship to models of course re-engineering that also foster instructional cohesiveness, by integrating the various learning events as interrelated nodes of a productive learning network",blended learning;digitized lectures;e-lectures;flexible learning;media in education,,"Anderson, L.W., Krathwohl, D.R., Airasian, P.W., Cruikshank, K.A., Mayer, P.R., Pintrich, P.R., Raths, J., Wittrock, M.C., (2001) A taxonomy for learning, teaching and assessing: A revision of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, , New York: Longman; Bell, T., Cockburn, A., McKenzie, B., Vargo, J., Digital Lectures: If you make them, will students use them?

This paper examines some of the benefits and issues for teachers in further and higher education surrounding the idea of learning design and its practical implementation in blended learning. It looks particularly at questions of documenting and representing learning designs so that they can be communicated to others. It explores the differing requirements of representations at various stages in the planning and sharing process, and for different communities of users, finding that multiple perspectives on a learning design are usually necessary. However, few representations to date have succeeded in capturing the essence of a good piece of teaching. Ways of representing designs as dynamic processes, rather than static products, may need to be developed.

The project was conducted as action research in 2002-06 by the research group LEETHi. LEETHi's projects focus on the teaching of literature from an intercultural perspective while helping to develop new media competence. The project also addresses - among other objectives - the intercultural potential of literary tests used in second language acquisition where their practical applications include the development and use of digital material for the study of European literatures with the integration of multiple languages and perspectives. A central issue is the potential of blended learning (i.e. the integration of elearning and contact learning) and the development of autonomy and communication between students and instructor. The online scenario focuses on the performance of tasks following sociocultural and constructivist theories and concepts borrowed from research on multimodality. ,didactic patterns for electronic materials;european literatures;hypertext;interculturalism,,"Anderson, L.W., Krathwohl, D.R., (2001) A Taxonomy of Learning, Teaching and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, , New York: Longman.

The model has been developed regarding the background of new requirements academic education is confronted with in the context of teaching students graduating into an e-literate society. Following several scientifically based recommendations on how to enable ""good learning"" and ""good online learning"" in particular, the DIAMOND framework has been set up considering different well-known pedagogical and didactical approaches. In the paper we discuss the main theories that build the basis for the DIAMOND concept. We then introduce the theory for ""good learning"" and factors that provide a good learning environment. Afterwards both the theoretical framework and the implementation of the DIAMOND concept, based on those insights, are presented and discussed in detail. In the blended learning environment, the active development of key competencies like information literacy, media competence and social skills is being supported and enabled. Collaboration and teamwork are strongly supported by a comprehensive software environment both between students and professors and among the peer groups themselves. Furthermore, new forms of knowledge representation and novel Web2.0 and semantic web concepts like topic maps are being employed in the teaching framework in order to provide multiple access options to the teaching material. A learner centered approach is hereby enabled using software like MediaWiki and e-Learning platforms. The three years of experience we've been able to gather with this concept encourage our hypothesis that a framework that enables the active development of key competencies is a step towards good academic education.

Especially, lecture recording has turned out to be a lightweight method particularly suited for existing lectures and blended learning strategies. In order to not only sequentially playback but offer full fledged navigation, search and inspection of the recorded lecture, chapter marks and search indices have to be embedded. To solve this, two basic approaches for lecture recording tools can be identified - both of them having certain advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand there are systems based on symbolic representation of common slideshow formats like MS PowerPoint. Therefore, they preserve structure and symbol information contained therein, but are lacking flexibility of supported dynamic and interactive formats. On the other hand there are systems based on pixel representation and screen grabbing technologies. While supporting any presentation content, structural and symbolic information cannot be extracted directly and thus has to be post-processed from the recorded video. This paper discusses a perspective of combining these approaches by widening the slide-metaphor to a more flexible scene-based presentation, preserving both the structural and symbolic information. One possible attempt for this is identified by introducing a browser-based scene concept. Symbolic information can be directly extracted from the XHTML source code and structural information derives from switching through scenes. The browser itself is capable of presenting a wide range of dynamic and interactive formats, thus offering more flexible presentations. For approving the proposed concepts, a prototype called ""Virtual Overhead"" was developed and evaluated",browser interactivity;lecture recording;lightweight content production;rapid e-learning,cost effectiveness;blended learning;content production;interactivity;learning materials;lecture recording;pixel representation;structural information;symbolic representation;e-learning,"Hurst, W., Lauer, T., Burfent, C., Gotz, G., Forward and backward speech skimming with the elastic audio slider (2005) Proc. of the 19th British HCI Group Annual Conference (HCI 2005), , Edinburgh, Scotland, UK; Kandzia, P.-T., Kraus, G., Ottmann, T., Der Universitare Lehrverbund Informatik - Eine Bilanz (2004) GI Softwaretechnik-Trends, 24 (1), pp. 54-61; Lauer, T., Ottmann, T., Means and methods in automatic courseware production: Experience and technical challenges (2002) Proc. of the World Conference on E-learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare and Higher Education (E-learn 2002), (1), pp. 553-560. , AACE Press, Montreal, Canada; Mertens, R., Rolf, R., Automation techniques for broadcasting and recording lectures and seminars (2003) Proc. of SINN03 - Third International Technical Workshop and Conference; Schutz, F., Producing e-Learning materials on the fly - Only a great dream?

Earlier evaluation studies pointed to a high level of student enthusiasm for accessing their learning, both within and outside the traditional timetabled hours. This has led to a diverse student culture where learning is accessed 24/7. This paper presents recent research undertaken by staff working in the Centre of Excellence for Learning and Teaching in Blended Learning, specifically into the use of video or e-diaries by students for supporting reflection on their own learning. It reports on two projects which used this technology to allow students to record personal opinions of their learning environments and experiences. Each student produced their own 'e-diary' (electronic diary) for a period of between five and seven days. They had the choice of three media for recording their week of learning: video cameras, voice recorders and weblogs. They were invited to comment on different aspects of e-learning provision at the university, and also on their lecturers' use of the university's MLE, called StudyNet, to support their learning experiences. While the number of participants in the study was small, the content of their diaries was intended to provide a snapshot of the student experiences of blended learning and thus an insight into their course and studying behaviours.

An online environment provides a rich opportunity to capture asynchronous group storytelling as it occurs in a formal class environment. This study focused on how a group story is created. Data included individual stories of four graduate student participants and the threads from their three-week, online discussion. Data analysis was collaborative among three researchers. The four participants used the online discussion to continue developing their own individual stories and to develop a group story. The women used temporality, shared themes, and epiphany to construct a story together. They extended a sense of agency to each other and to the group, using this aspect of their dialogue to reframe and recast individual stories and the group story. Implications for teaching and learning environments are discussed.

Learner characteristics, consisting of motivation, personality and thinking styles, were measured at the beginning and end of the term. Learning strategies and learners' evaluation of their e-learning experience were also measured. Additional data was collected from the number of days attended, the number of modules completed, and test scores. Master students' evaluation of their e-learning experience increased significantly throughout the course. Conscientiousness correlated positively with the number of e-learning modules completed by master students (r=0.35), suggesting a better understanding of the benefits of e-learning as more motivated students use e-learning experience effectively. For bachelor students, the number of online modules completed correlated with both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. These results suggest that understanding the benefits of elearning and learner characteristics, and knowing how to work with e-learning content, could provide the keys for promoting success in online learning",blended learning;learner characteristics;learning performance;learning practice;path analysis,e-learning;education;motivation;regression analysis;social networking (online);students;teaching;blended learning;learner characteristics;learning performance;learning practice;path analysis;learning systems,"Birch, P.D., E-learner competencies (2002) Learning Circuits - ASTD Online Magazine, , http://www.learningcircuits.org/2002/jul2002/birch.html, July, Retrieved 11 January, 2006 from; Diaz, D.P., Cartnal, R.B., Students' learning styles in two classes: Online distance learning and equivalent on-campus (1999) College Teaching, 47 (4), pp. 130-135; Dick, W., Carey, L., (1996) The Systematic Design of Instruction, , 4th Ed.

The use of a digital interpreting laboratory and the new teaching paths that are now open through the internet, such as interpreting e- or distance learning, are explored, such as the use of new digitalized sources of input for interpreting practice and the convenient storage and retrieval of student exercises on a digital format. The development of interpreting training materials suitable for this new learning environment and the actual design of teaching units and their components is also explained. An online interpreting platform that allows both for the provision of such materials and the storage of students practice files has been devised, and the procedure for their collection is given in detail. The site also provides with links of all sort of resources the trainee might need in order to accomplish practice work. Materials are aimed both at developing interpreting subskills, such as comprehension or public speaking skill and at training the whole task. In order to design appropriate courses within this new environment, a look into the field of Educational Technology is needed. In our approach, e-learning is viewed as an extension of the physical class; as such the online tool has proved efficient. Situated cognition and constructivist paradigms are applied to the teaching of interpreting in the new learning environments. After examining the pros and cons of the distance learning mode and the interpreting task, the authors advocate blended learning as the one that best meets interpreter training goals at present, although they are aware there is still a long way to go in CAIT (Computer Assisted Interpreter Training).

Mental health and substance use services in prisons should have the capabilities to address their needs while incarcerated and facilitate the transfer of care to community services on release. In order to develop these capabilities, a training programme is required.A pilot training programme for dual diagnosis was developed and piloted in five London prisons. The training was based on a training needs assessment of prison staff and consultation with service users. It was delivered in two forms: a five-day classroom based course, and a ‘blended learning’ method that comprised a manual and three sessions of supervision. The course was evaluated by a brief questionnaire that included items on attitudes, self-efficacy and knowledge about working with dual diagnosis.The evaluation of the training revealed that all workers, no matter what method of training they received increased their perception of their skills (self-efficacy) and increased their attitudes. Knowledge remained the same (although the scores pre-training were high). There was no difference between the two types of training when mean scores were compared at post-training. There was also no difference between the mental health and substance workers regarding their mean scores at follow-up, apart from knowledge.The conclusion is that the training pilot was evaluated positively and did indicate that it has some effect on attitudes and self-efficacy. More rigorous evaluation of the impact of the training is required, using a robust methodology and assessing the impact on clinical skills and service user outcomes.

This raises various questions for traditional distance as well as face-to-face universities internationally and in particular in Australia. A key area where many issues arise is the development process to create effective digitally-enhanced learning environments within a blended learning milieu. A comparative study of Australian Universities has been conducted in 2006 to identify factors in the development of learning materials and environments that support effective blended learning that is digitally enhanced. The prominent team-approach for the development of learning materials (Bates, 1993; DEC working party, 1989; Garrison, 1989; Holmberg, 1995) has been one of the foci of the study. Innovative approaches have been identified in learning material development that could benefit both Australian and international universities that are pursuing blended learning which is digitally enhanced.

What online pedagogic principles can be applied to create a blended learning approach with minimum effort, in terms of time spent creating online content, but maximum success, in terms of facilitating so-called independent learning by the students? The intention is to identify a workable approach applicable to engineering teaching. In the paper, the approach adopted is applied retrospectively to a blended learning module and it is demonstrated how some of the evaluations results could have been anticipated. The paper closes with suggestions for how this approach, based on educational research, can be more effectively disseminated to the engineering academic community",,academic community;blended learning;design frameworks;educational research;first year;learning outcome;on-line contents;online pedagogy;time spent;engineering education;teaching;research,"Oliver, R., Herrington, J., Exploring technology-mediated learning from a pedagogical perspective (2003) Journal of Interactive Learning Environments, 11 (2), pp. 111-126; MacDonald Ross, G., (2005) HEA Academy Exchange, (2), pp. 16-18; Rossiter, J.A., Rossiter, D., Student usage of web-based resources for engineering teaching (2004) Proceedings of UKACC International Conference on Control, , Bath, UK; Rossiter, J.A., Gray, L., Rossiter, D., Case studies of the resources students use (2005) Proceedings of 16th IFAC World Congress, , Prague, Czech Republic; Roblyer, M.D., Edwards, J., (2001) Integrating Educational Technology into Teaching, 2nd Ed., , Saddlebrook, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Certificate in Learning and Teaching (CiLT), , http://www.shef.ac.uk/ldmu/can-do/lt-supp/cilt.html, The University of Sheffield accessed 26 Jan.'06; Biggs, J., (1999) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , Buckingham: SRHE and Open University Press, UK; Ramsden, P., (1992) Learning to Teach in Higher Education, , Routledge, London, UK; Laurillard, D., (2002) Rethinking University Teaching, , 2nd Ed., RoutledgeFalmer, New York, USA; http://www.webct.com, accessed 25 Jan. 2006; Rossiter, D., Rossiter, J.A., (2006) Developing An Online Learning Community Using A Blended Learning Approach to Teaching 1st Year Engineers, , in preparation; Macromedia Flash Professional Software, , http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/flashpro/?promoid=BINT, accessed 29 Jan'06","Proc Int Conf Innov, Good Pract Res Eng Educ, EE",Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857683607,2,0.5,United Kingdom,United Kingdom,university of manchester;Unversity of Sheffield,university of manchester,academic community;achieve;answer;approach;closes;community;content;create;decide;design;design framework;educational research;effort;engineering;engineering teaching;evaluation result;evaluations;explores;framework;help;herrington1;independent learning;intention;lecturer;lecturer decide;literature;maximum;maximum success;minimum;minimum effort;module;much online;oliver;online;online content;online pedagogic;outcomes;paper;paper close;paper explores;pedagogic;pedagogic principle;principles;questions;research;research literature;results;spent;students;success;sufficient;suggestions;terms;time;time spent;workable approach,applications;first year;module;online;online pedagogy;pedagogy;vle;year,648

However, questions remain over the educational utility of OADs. In particular, relatively little is known about how students use online discussions and the ways and extent to which their use enhances learning. Previous research seeking to investigate the correlation between discussion board use and exam results has proved problematic and open to misinterpretation. Analysis of the content of online discussions may provide a more fruitful way of discovering the impact on student learning, but this approach can appear overly complex and time-consuming. This paper describes a small scale research project which pilots a number of different methods for analysing online discussions and considers the advantages and disadvantages with each approach, both in terms of methodological simplicity and utility of findings.

CBR is an innovative instructional approach that utilizes the specific knowledge of previously experienced problem situations (cases). A new problem can be solved by finding a similar past case and reusing it in the new problem situation. Then a new case is retained each time when a problem has been solved, making it immediately available for future problem.

These models, if adequately designed, may stimulate the development of competencies in teachers' training. Technological evolution has made the use of telematic tools more and more of an option in distance learning; these tools have become an indispensable support for achievement of educational aims in learning institutions, namely through the provision of means for the interaction between participants. This work now aims at describing some of the results obtained from a study involving telematic tools in a model of online teachers' training. In particular, we will describe the benefits and difficulties that were found and we add some reflections on solutions for the improvement of this model.

In face-to-face and online courses, curriculum is often developed by staff in isolation, with a focus on presenting content rather than on learning design that promotes student engagement with content as well as interaction with peers and instructor. This paper describes the design, implementation, evaluation and next steps of the 'e-Scholars Programme', an innovative approach to staff development designed to guide faculty as a cohort to successfully integrate online learning with the face-to-face classroom using the T5 instructional design model (Salter, Richards, & Carey, 2003, 2004) to expand the learning environment.

Initial development was based upon adaptation of 'at presence' material for use with an existing remote access laboratory based upon a standard internet link The selected course material for adaptation was a PLL (phase-locked loop) circuit. Initially, the remote lab interface was developed with minimal modifications to the existing hardware and the process produced satisfactory results in terms of enhancement of the learning / teaching experience. However, it was evident that some aspects of the course material could be enhanced via appropriate modifications to the existing hardware and software framework. The goal is to work towards a blended learning infrastructure. The paper thus provides observations on the initial course development and then provides details of suggested and ongoing modifications to the material.

This article describes an application project, which is financially supported by la Consejeria de Educacion de la Junta de Castilla y Leon (Education Authority of the Regional Government of Castilla y Leon). An educational interaction system called QUEST (Quest Environment for Self-managed Training) is proposed. The system is based on telematics and allows the carrying out of cooperative and competitive workshops. QUEST presents individual and group work environments in which several intellectual challenges, that must be solved in a time-constrained way, are proposed to the students.

Then, ICT have offered a favorable environment for the development and use of various methods and tools. With the developments in technology, blended learning has gained considerable popularity in recent years. Together with the developments it brought along the description of particular forms of teaching with technology. Blended learning is defined simply as a learning environment that combines technology with face-to-face learning. In other words blended learning means using a variety of delivery methods to best meet the course objectives by combining face-to-face teaching in a traditional classroom with teaching online. This article examines students' views on blended learning environment. The study was conducted on 64 students from Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technologies in 2005-2006 fall semester in Instructional Design and Authoring Languages in PC Environment at Hacettepe University. The results showed that the students enjoyed taking part in the blended learning environment. Students' achievement levels and their frequency of participation to forum affected their views about blended learning environment. Face-to-face interaction in blended learning application had the highest score.

(Ancient Oriental Proverb) IDC-Herzliya is a 12-year-old private university in Israel, focussing on BA and MA programs in Law, Business Administration, Government (political science) and Information Technology. English proficiency is given high priority as an extremely high percentage of graduates are accepted into graduate programs in England and the USA. Every classroom at IDC is equipped with a podium containing a computer with internet access, high-band streaming, DVD, VCR and CD equipment. Many excellent and experienced teachers, however, are intimidated by the technology and equipment. Others have incorporated the features of Blended Learning into their teaching. This paper will compare two matched groups of students (28 students per group) studying English for Academic Purposes in the field of government - one studying in the classic F2F mode, the other via blended learning. This paper will examine the two delivery modes over the course of one year: • A1 - the traditional face-to-face classroom with textbook, assignments, group work, etc., • A2 - blended learning: all F2F elements + e-mail, web searches, videos, video conferencing, forums. The research findings will include final exam and final course results, and student feedback.

CALL programs, incorporated into distance-learning systems, offer students wide range of texts, multimedia materials, pre-structured exercises, tests, etc. In the paper, interconnection between elearning Omega system and CALL course is given. As the course represents combination of theory, evaluation, development of individual practical skills and students' teamwork, advantages of the elearning system will be presented. Use of new technologies in language learning offers unlimited possibilities, but also recognizes the irreplaceable role of teacher whose organizing and communication capabilities enforce interactive communication. Demanding higher level of linguistic knowledge and computer skills, use of elearning system in CALL course would be more suitable for advanced learners as a supplement material to classical teaching.

After a pilot group was introduced to e-learning and conclusions made, the University implemented e-learning for the whole group of Computer Skills students. The purpose is to reflect on the pilot group's results, as well as the results obtained by the whole group. In the analysis of the results of the pilot group it was found that students had adapted well to online learning. An interesting result was noted in the section on spreadsheets, where the online assessment showed mastery of this section of the work, while the written assessment, which was used for comparison with the control group, showed no mastery in the pilot study. In the results of the whole e-learning group the Excel results was the highest of all sections of the work.

Our research focuses on how to blend these elements efficiently with the different theoretical and practical content layers of an introductory course “Teaching English as a Foreign Language” to foster the development of critical, reflective thinking of prospective teachers of English and to empower the learners. In this paper we discuss the concept of autonomy as a course strategy and argue that enabling a student to take responsibility and to make informed choices is the main route to an autonomous learner. We introduce and analyze learning activities such as working with multimedia-based case stories that include video episodes as situational anchors and conducting an einterview. These learning activities are two formats that integrate elearning and contact learning in a directed, interactive way to foster the learner's autonomy. The study is a follow-up of a pilot study on blended learning in a teacher training course and was conducted as action research in the 2004/05 winter semester. It combines qualitative and quantitative research methods and integrates multiple perspectives on the teaching and learning scenarios.

In the state of Victoria, Australia, the child protection service is delivered by a state government department, the Department of Human Services, employing over 900 staff. A significant proportion of its recruitment is achieved through employing new graduates from a diverse educational base (e.g. social work, psychology and welfare). This convergence of circumstances, inexperienced workers with a variety of professional education backgrounds, beginning work in a complex, highly scrutinised professional domain, creates a unique challenge for in‐service educators responsible for induction. The ‘Beginning Practice in Child Protection’ programme is an attempt to meet this challenge, employing multi‐modal learning resources, interactive skills based clinics combined with workplace learning opportunities structured to deliver just‐in‐time messages. In addition, on‐line ‘virtual vignettes’ that support learning at the employee workstation are utilised. Evaluation findings suggest this programme is successful in achieving its aims of a supported introduction to the work, increasing worker confidence and satisfaction while leading to quality knowledge and skills acquisition. This paper will establish the context for child protection practice in Victoria, describe the programme designed to address the need, before highlighting key messages arising from an independent evaluation.

When the training program involves specialized content and the need for the trainees to meet an international professional standard, the challenges multiply. This case study discusses the development of an online program for international aviation personnel who must meet a newly mandated English language proficiency level. The collaborative effort to design and implement such an Aviation English program has involved two corporations plus a host of subject matter experts (SMEs) in the fields of both aviation and linguistics. In parallel, a program for Business English followed the same developmental path. For each specialized area, a test was written to assess trainees' English language proficiency and to place them in the appropriate course level. The program design includes a variety of methods of course delivery, from self-paced online instruction to several models of blended learning, which includes classroom instruction to supplement online courses. Blended learning adds the challenge of developing a team of instructors who can be placed in international locations, as well as training onsite corporate instructors when needed.

How can we convey this obligation to them in a way that is not boring or preachy? We have to involve students in their discovery of 'good' and 'evil. ' Rochester Institute of Technology's 'Ethics in Information Technology' class uses active classroom learning via role-plays, mock trials, debates and interruption skits, in addition to the anonymity and freedom of a distance learning class. This class has evolved from a traditional model, to a Blended model, using various technologies to reach the students. Varying kinds of courseware were used. Weblogs have captured the interest of students, providing opportunity to remain anonymous to classmates (but known to the teacher), which has resulted in more dynamic and intense discussions. This paper describes the evolution of Ethics in Information Technology as a course intended to engage students in understanding and practicing ethical behavior in Computing and Information Sciences, which will hopefully guide their professional lives.

But because of a usually fragmented development process (several co-existing generations of design, development over a longer time, many contributors, etc.), both presentation and interaction might vary widely between such materials, even within a single course offering. Furthermore, a common didactic model (what information is present, where and how it can be accessed, etc.) is hard to achieve. In this paper we propose a framework intended to address some of these issues by streamlining didactic, organizational and technical aspects of interactive e-learning examples. This framework has already been used and evaluated in the development of several such examples, which have been deployed in a blended-learning setting at the university level. While it is particularly well suited for visualizing various kinds of algorithms, it has also proven applicable for other types of interactive examples",e-learning;frame-work;interactive algorithm visualization;uniform interaction and didactic models,algorithms;information technology;interactive computer systems;mathematical models;visualization;e-learning;framework;interactive algorithm visualization;uniform interaction and didactic models;learning systems,"Hammer, N., Desing of design: Die gestaltung von mediendesign lerneinheiten im virtuellen studiengang medieninformatik (2002) Proc. 32nd Annual GI Conference, pp. 385-392. , Bonn; Gauss, B., Urbas, L., Hausmanns, C., Zerry, R., Systemic approach to integrating new media into academic teaching - A case study (2003) Proc. 2003 EDEN Annual Conference, pp. 385-390. , Eden; Jansen, W., Van De Hooven, H., Jagers, H.P.M., Steenbakkers, W., The added value of e-learning (2002) Proc.

As part of the project, a case study and a so-called blended learning scenario were developed. The study focused on the lurkers or the students who never took an active role in online classes. The case study was structured on a blended lecture that consisted of both classroom and online work over a four-month period. Lecture was conducted from November to February every year, and student participation in its online portion was studied for three years. Data were collected for three research questions for the academic years 2001-2002, 2002-2003, and 2003-2004. The research questions were as follows: Does a higher level of online interactivity lead to a better learning result?; Does a learner who writes [posts] more contributions than a lurker automatically read more postings than a comparable lurking learner?; How extensive is their effort in such an e-learning scenario?. With the help of an online and a traditional evaluation, it was possible to determine what the learners themselves feel about the use of discussion forums during their learning process. Some students liked working with online discussion.

T2N 1N4, Canada",The focus of this study was to understand how a blended learning approach can support the inquiry process (cognitive presence) in a faculty development context. The findings from this study indicate that there are several key differences and similarities in cognitive presence between face-to-face and online discussions. These differences and similarities are specifically related to the four phases of cognitive presence of the practical inquiry model. A comparison of the face-to-face and online discussion forums indicates that: a slightly higher percentage of triggering events occurred in the face-to-face discussions; exploration was the dominant phase in both environments; a noticeably greater percentage of comments were coded for integration in the online discussions; and the resolution/application phase was almost non-existent in both forms of discussion. The results from this study imply that an increased emphasis should be placed on teaching presence within a blended learning environment to ensure that participants achieve resolution in the inquiry cycle. ,blended learning;cognitive presence;community of inquiry;faculty development community;triggering events,cognitive systems;communication systems;distance education;online systems;teaching;video conferencing;blended learning;cognitive presence;community of inquiry;faculty development community;triggering presence;learning systems,"Ackroyd, S., Hughes, J.A., (1981) Data Collection in Context, , Longman New York; Aycock, A., Garnham, C., Kaleta, R., Lessons learned from the hybrid course project (2002) Teaching with Technology Today, 8 (6). , http://www.uwsa.edu/ttt/articles/garnham2.htm, Retrieved July 21, 2004; Blanchette, J., Questions in the online learning environment (2001) Journal of Distance Education, 16 (2), pp. 37-57; Cohen, J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, pp. 37-46; Garnham, C., Kaleta, R., Introduction to hybrid courses (2002) Teaching with Technology Today, 8 (6). , http://www.uwsa.edu/ttt/articles/garnham.htm, Retrieved July 21, 2004; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., (2003) E-learning in the 21st Century: A Framework for Research and Practice, , RoutledgeFalmer London; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., Archer, W., Critical thinking in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education (2000) Internet and Higher Education, 11 (2), pp. 1-14. , http://communitiesofinquiry.com/documents/CTinTextEnvFinal.pdf, Retrieved July 21, 2004; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., Archer, W., Critical thinking, cognitive presence, and computer conferencing in distance education (2001) American Journal of Distance Education, 15 (1), pp. 17-23. , http://communitiesofinquiry.com/documents/CogPresPaper_June30_.pdf, Retrieved on July 21, 2004; Garrison, D.R., Cleveland-Innes, M., Facilitating Cognitive Presence in Online Learning: Interaction Is Not Enough, , unpublished manuscript; Holsti, O., (1969) Content Analysis for the Social Sciences and Humanities, , Addison-Wesley Publishing Don Mills; Kanuka, H., Anderson, T., Online social interchange, discord, and knowledge construction (1998) Journal of Distance Education, 13 (1), pp. 57-75; McKlin, T., Harmon, S.W., Evans, W., Jones, M.G., Cognitive presence in web based learning: A content analysis of students' online discussions (2002) IT Forum, 60; Meyer, K.A., Face-to-face versus threaded discussions: The role of time and higher-order thinking (2003) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 7 (3), pp. 55-65; Meyer, K.A., Evaluating online discussions: Four different frames of analysis (2004) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 8 (2), pp. 101-114; Newman, D.R., Webb, B., Cochrane, C., The evaluating quality of learning in computer supported co-operative learning (1997) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 48 (6), pp. 484-495; Owston, R., Garrison, D.R., Cook, K., Blended learning at Canadian universities: Issues and practices (2004) The Handbook of Blended Learning, , C.

The core question when designing a BL environment is: Which combination of modes provides the optimal basis for language learning and teaching given the particular conditions at hand? In order to tackle this question, course designers need a framework of parameters that help them decide on the individual, context-related implementation of BL. It is the purpose of this paper to put forward a definition of BL and a framework of parameters for designing a BL environment. In order to achieve a better understanding of the factors that shape the practice and the experience of BL, the main parameters which form a BL environment will be listed and specified. These parameters evolved from the experience of designing Jobline LMU (www.jobline.lmu.de) and will hopefully prove to be helpful for the process of designing other BL environments. If applied successfully, the idea of BL could serve as a bridge between the broader community of language teachers and learners and CALL experts and practitioners. BL offers the potential of broadening the scope and influence of CALL and of (re-)establishing it as an innovative component of general language teaching.

Reflecting on the different on-line teaching approach required to present material which necessitated careful explanation and examples in a traditional classroom mode of teaching, the authors set out to address some of the key differences between the two modes. When some of the learning material was brought into a blended learning context where an MLE was available freely for students to supplement their face-to-face learning, the reflection came full circle and resulted in applying the lessons learnt from the on-line environment to provide the best of both of the previous modes. In this paper the authors follow the example of one course as it has been designed, refined and reviewed for students firstly face-to-face, then on-line and finally in a blended approach to learning. Following through a course in this way has enabled the authors to review how to design content in areas where their experience tells them that students may have difficulty. Progressive explanations, carefully worked examples and the use of small Flash animations helped to explain to on-line students the detail of a modelling technique which normally requires teacher explanation and student participation. Building in 'on-line pauses' gave students the time to think through the material and then test their own understanding with formative on-line questions. The material was then introduced into a course using a blended learning approach where students could benefit from the new supplementary material on-line as well as the teacher's own reflection on developing a set of learner focussed activities for extra support in the face-to-face environment. Is this becoming 'the best of all possible' learning worlds?

The development from a ‘traditional’ didactic to a constructivist approach based upon Moshman's theory of dialectical constructivism is examined through the implementation of web-facilitated enquiry-based teaching practices. It is argued that to prepare students to work in situations of diversity, a ‘knowledge banking’ approach is inadequate. Instead, teaching and learning processes that encourage students to engage in critically reflective practices, allowing them to question existing knowledge, beliefs and feelings, will equip them with the problem-solving skills required to work in highly fluid situations. A detailed analysis of how web-based technologies, integrated into an enquiry-based teaching and learning approach, can develop these skills through knowledge construction is explored.

A typical form of e-learning applications comprises exercise submission and assessment systems that allow students to work on assignments whenever and where they want (i.e., dislocated, asynchronous work). In basic computer science courses, programming exercises are widely used and courses have a very large number of participants. However, there is still no efficient way for supporting tutors to correct these exercises, as experience has shown that correction (and, beyond that, automatic grading) are difficult. In this paper we present an enhancement of the xLx platform developed at the University of Muenster to efficiently support tutors in handling Java programming exercises electronically. The new component is based on concepts of automatic static and dynamic testing approaches, well known from software engineering, and provides an automatic pre-correction of submitted solutions. In addition, a tutor is able to annotate solutions manually, by adding comments that are associated with the source code of the solution in an intelligent way. Static tests are based on a compilation of the sources to find syntactical errors, while dynamic tests use test cases defined by tutors during the creation of the exercises and have to be executed correctly on the solutions in order to receive credits for the exercises",automatic pre-correction;blended learning;e-learning;programming exercises,computer programming;e-learning;grading;software engineering;software testing;teaching;assessment system;automatic grading;blended learning;computer science course;e-learning application;e-learning platforms;pre corrections;programming exercise;java programming language,"Downes, S., Learning Objects: Resources for Distances Education Worldwide (2001) International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 2 (1); Hatcher, E., Java Development with ANT (2002) Hanning, Book News, Inc, , Portland, OR; Husemann, B., Lechtenborger, J., Vossen, G., Westerkamp, P., XLX - A Platform for Graduate-Level Exercises (2002) Proc.

Maritime education and training is regulated by the international maritime organization's code on Seafarer's training, certification and watchkeeping. Onboard training comprises one third of the deck officer and engineer studies. There have been problems in arranging training for the onboard training officers that are responsible for supervising the maritime academy students on their shipborne onboard training. A blended learning approach was applied in order to enhance the accessibility and content of the training for the onboard training officers. The combination of classroom teaching, a CD-ROM study material, a Web site and an Internet-based discussion forum turned out to be a promising method to serve these aims. However, some interesting development options still remain open for experimenting. ",,,"(1996) STCW Code London, , IMO (International Maritime Organization Chapters II and III; (1996) IMO. STCW Code.

In a blended learning environment, non-English-speaking trainees often need to adapt to the concept of computer-aided instruction or learning online while they learn how to cope with a new and different teaching style. For example, in a typical classroom, where interactivity is a goal, an Asian learner may have a difficult time overcoming his or her traditional role as respectful listener. An Asian learner who has never worked with computer-aided instruction may find it difficult to cope with learning the system while having to master the content delivered through the system. This paper examines learning styles preferred by Asian learners and how these preferred styles affect the delivery of a blended learning Aviation English program to be delivered in China.

However, the question arises what's it all about. Primarily the term new media describes any digital media production that is interactive and digitally distributed. Blended learning incorporates a blend of different methods such as traditional learning and e-learning and its goal is to effectively reach all individuals in a given audience. The spomedial project serves as an interface between learning theories and how they can be realized in sports medical teaching practice. Supported by the German Ministry of Education and Research (bmb+f), an e-learning platform was developed, presenting in modules all sports medical contents, which are accessible online as well as offline. Spomedial mainly addresses instructors, students and all interested persons in the fields of sports sciences and medicine during their studies or continuing education. In addition to the spomedial-learning environment, a database could be set up where all the interactive multimedia components are stored.

We first define the bases of the training program and present several tools (logbook, portfolio and questionnaires) which have been used to evaluate and regulate both training and the individual learning process. Our observations indicate an increase and better regulation of the quality of the educational and learning processes. On the basis of the results we achieved, we propose that our original design could be extended to similar adult training programs. The way this innovative system is integrated in the universities shows an evolution due to its success that implies a certain kind of return on investment due to the demand of such kinds of device.

This principle is no less true for instructors in an academic setting. As technology advances, faculty are increasingly challenged not only to engage students, but maintain learner interest throughout content presentation. Lectures and overhead transparencies have been overused and today are often ineffective, especially when competing with presentation software files, videos, DVDs, CDs, and distance learning techniques; consequently, maintaining participant engagement becomes a daunting task for facilitators of learning. Digital storytelling has recently come to the forefront as both an accompaniment and an alternative to traditional delivery modes. With the advent of easy-to-use scanning, presentation, video editing, and sound recording software at reasonable prices, instructors have more options. This presentation and paper review the process and the results of a digital story workshop conducted with faculty at California Lutheran University",blended learning;digital storytelling;distance learning;faculty development;instructional delivery;instructional design;instructional technology;presentation software;student engagement;video editing,compact disks;computer software;computer supported cooperative work;digital television;distance education;education computing;human engineering;sound recording;students;technical presentations;video conferencing;videodisks;blended learning;digital storytelling;faculty development;instructional delivery;instructional technology;presentation software;video editing;computer aided instruction,,31st Ann ACM SIGUCSS Fall Conf (SIGUSS Conf Proc),Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1542286932,1,1.0,United States,United States,california lutheran university,california lutheran university,academic setting;accompaniment;advances;advent;alternative;andor;andor help;audience;becomes;california;california lutheran;cds;challenged;concept;content;content presentation;delivery;delivery mode;digital;digital story;digital storytelling;distance;distance learning;dvds;easytouse;engage;engage student;engagement;engagement becomes;facilitators;faculty;files;forefront;help;instructors;interest;learner;learner interest;learning technique;lectures;lutheran;lutheran university;maintain;maintain learner;modes;options;overhead;overhead transparency;paper;paper review;participant;participant engagement;point;point andor;presentation;presentation software;presentations;prices;principle;process;reasonable price;results;review;software;software file;sound;speakers;stories;story;story workshop;students;task;techniques;technology;technology advance;today;traditional delivery;transparencies;university;value;video;videos;workshop,power;story,696
