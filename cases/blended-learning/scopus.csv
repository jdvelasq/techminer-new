In particular, by integrating formal traditional courses with informal learning approaches, MOOCs have been expanding the position as a learning platform to provide students with diverse learning experiences delivered through blended learning modalities. This chapter aims to discuss how MOOCs have been integrated into higher education contexts to blend formal, non-formal and informal learning experiences. An integration framework suggested in this chapter is based on two factors, namely credit recognition and online learning that lead to three types of MOOC-integrated learning experiences: Type I—formal MOOC learning, Type II—formal blended MOOC learning, and Type III—non-formal/informal MOOC learning. Based on this framework, we mainly illustrate three integration approaches, namely blended learning, flipped learning, and non-formal/informal learning experiences, with relevant research studies. The chapter concludes with some suggestions for research directions that can inform future research on integrating formal and non-formal/informal learning experiences through MOOCs in higher education. © 2020, The Author(s).",Blended learning; Flipped learning; Formal learning; Informal learning; MOOCs; Non-formal learning,,"Abdelrahman, A.M., MOOCs integration in the formal education (2016) International Journal for Infonomics, 9 (3), pp. 1210-1216; Akgül, Y., Accessibility evaluation of MOOCs’ websites of turkey (2018) Journal of Life Economics, 5 (4), pp. 23-36; Alraimi, K.M., Zo, H., Ciganek, A.P., Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation (2014) Computers & Education, 80, pp. 28-38; Atiaja, L., Gueerero, R., MOOCs: Origin, characterization, principal problems and challenges in higher education (2016) Journal of E-Learning and Knowledge Society, 12 (1), pp. 65-76; Baker, R.M., Passmore, D.L., Value and pricing of MOOCs (2016) Education Sciences, 6, pp. 1-11. , https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci6020014; Belanger, V., Thornton, J., (2013) Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach-Duke University’s First MOOC, , http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/6216/Duke_Bioelectricity_MOOC_Fall2012.pdf, Report).

However, recent literature has revealed that developing countries' educational institutions fail when they adopt LMS technologies because they ignore the human factors related to these technologies. This study investigated the impact of human factors on the effectiveness of LMS in a blended learning environment at Kuwait's HEIs (KHEIs). In this paper, a pragmatic approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods is used. User characteristics traits from the literature review were organized into three main indicators of human impact on the effectiveness of LMS: technological characteristics, psychological characteristics, and student-instructor interaction characteristics. After these indicators were identified, a conceptual model was developed to study the characteristics. A deductive approach was used, and the model was tested for significance through receiving feedback from the universities' students and faculty members. In addition, an inductive approach was implemented through conducting interviews to explore more factors related to the effectiveness of LMS. The inductive approach's results revealed the relevant factors for the usage of the LMS, such as training, needs, expectations, and branding. The human factors that positively affect the success and effectiveness of LMS included attitude, enjoyment, experience, self-efficacy, and promptness, which had the most substantial impacts on user satisfaction. The modified conceptual model that this paper presents includes these impacting factors and provides an acceptable fit to the data. This research has developed an updated framework for demonstrating the effectiveness of LMS as it pertains to human factors, and its findings can be used to enhance user experience in a blended learning environment, thus improving the quality of Kuwaiti education. © 2013 IEEE.",blended learning; effectiveness of LMS; human factors; Kuwait's higher education institutions; Learning management systems (LMSs),Computer aided instruction; Developing countries; Education computing; Human engineering; Students; User experience; Blended learning; effectiveness of LMS; Higher education institutions; Learning management system; Psychological characteristics; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Student-instructor interactions; Technological characteristics; Learning systems,"Nikoli, V., Petkovi, D., Deni, N., Milovanevi, M., Gavrilovi, S., Appraisal and review of e-learning and ICT systems in teaching process (2019) Phys.

This article describes the evaluation phase of a blended course of English for general academic purposes (EGAP) targeting second-year undergraduate Japanese students mostly from the Faculties of Law, Letters, Economics, and Human Sciences at Osaka University. In this study, the researchers adopted an inclusive approach to blended course evaluation. In order to ensure the course quality from the outset, the Fifth Edition of Quality Matters Higher Education Course Design Rubric was utilized as the major reference. As part of the evaluation process, students’ perception on the usefulness of the course was also measured quantitatively and qualitatively through an attitudinal survey instrument and open ended reflection questions. Eventually, to add an outsider positionality, the blended course was peer-reviewed by a certified reviewer from Quality Matters (QM) after having been self-reviewed by the researchers. The findings of the evaluation survey demonstrated students’ overall satisfaction with the course, and their responses to the open-ended questions provided further insight into the educational and technical difficulties they encountered. The QM peer review also yielded a score of 70 out of 99, resulting in failure to meet the essential standards. However, comments from the peer reviewer guided the refinements and improvement of the course design, and the course currently meets all the requirements of the Higher Education Course Design Rubric (Fifth Edition) upon amendment. This study discusses the implications for design, development, and evaluation of English-as-a-foreign-language blended courses and provides practical tips for online/blended course designers. Further refinements to the existing course can be made in the future by implementing it several times with various groups of students. © 2019, The Author(s).",Blended learning; English for general academic purposes; Evaluation; Quality Matters,,"Adair, D., A process to improve course design: A key variable in course quality (2014) Assuring Quality in Online Education: Practices and Processes at the Teaching, Resource, and Program Levels, pp. 81-90. , K.

This paper describes a successful use of TAs in the blended learning (blearning) courses of Computer Basis at a comprehensive university in China. The purpose of this study is to analyze the TAs' crucial behaviors influencing the evaluation of TAs' teaching performance from students. In total, 3009 valid data were collected from students using online survey, and a sequential mixed-method analysis was implemented. The empirical results indicate that TAs' tutoring for students in practice classes and after class has significantly positive influence on the overall evaluation from students. Furthermore, TAs need to improve themselves in leading group discussion and explaining assignments through the Learning Management System. © 2019 IEEE.",B-learning; Influencing behaviors; Practical classes; Teaching assistants; Teaching performance,Education computing; Teaching; B-learning; Blended learning; Group discussions; Influencing behaviors; Learning management system; Online surveys; Practical classes; Teaching assistants; Students,"Reck, R.M., The influence of teaching assistants in an undergraduate engineering laboratory course (2017) 2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), pp. 1-6; Riese, E., Teaching assistants' experiences of lab sessions in introductory computer science courses (2018) 2018 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), pp. 1-5; Nasser-Abu Alhija, F., Fresko, B., Graduate teaching assistants: How well do their students think they do?

The three groups are students who studied the lesson and fully understand the contents, students who studied the lesson but do not fully understand the contents, and students who did not study the lesson and so do not understand the contents. The face-to-face learning in class is done separately for each group. We called this a 'grouped flipped classroom.' We applied the above grouped flipped classroom method to 16 weeks of actual lessons in the autumn semester of 2017 at our university. The results revealed that the grouped flipped classroom improved students' performance. In particular, for the group of students who had low understanding during self-study, there was a statistically significant difference between their average scores in the tests after the self-study and after the face-to-face lesson. In addition, the average score in the test after the face-to-face lesson was higher for students in the grouped flipped classroom than for students in conventional style classes (lecture style class and mixed ability class). © 2018 IEEE.",Blended-Learning; e-Learning; Effective Classroom; Flipped-Classroom,E-learning; Blended learning; Classroom method; Effective Classroom; Face to face; Face-to-face learning; Flipped-Classroom; Lecture style; Statistically significant difference; Students,"Bergmann, J., Sams, A., (2012) Flip Your Classroom: Reach Every Student in Every Class Every Day, , International Society for Technology in Education, Washington, DC; Sams, A., Bergmann, J., Flip your students' learning (2013) Educational Leadership, 70 (6), pp. 16-20; Umezawa, K., Aramoto, M., Kobayashi, M., Ishida, T., Nakazawa, M., Hirasawa, S., An effective flipped classroom based on the log information of the self-study (2015) Proc. of the 3rd Int.

The programming courses are taught by applying a traditional learning method in which the programming concepts are explained theoretically and minimal practical work is applied. In addition, students receive either no formative feedback or minimal manual delayed feedback after submitting their practical work. This negatively affects students' performance as students find it difficult to understand the programming concepts. This paper addresses the aforementioned drawbacks by applying blended learning for the first time to the C programming course which is taught to more than 1000 students each year at An-Najah National University, Palestine. Blended learning is a hybrid learning method which integrates the traditional learning method with technology and online learning. It provides students with more practical work and automated immediate formative feedback. This paper aims to study the effect of blended learning on students' performance, and students' satisfaction with the blended learning method. An independent experimental design was applied on 1374 undergraduate students enrolled in C programming course. Students were divided into two groups based on the learning method. The first group consisted of 632 students who studied the course using the traditional learning method, while the second group consisted of 742 students in which blended learning was applied. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were applied and the results revealed that blended learning improved student performance significantly compared with traditional learning. In addition, the results revealed that students were satisfied with the blended learning method in terms of easiness to use and suitability for programming and submitting assignments. © 2013 IEEE.",Automatic evaluation; blended learning; e-learning; formative feedback; performance; traditional learning method; Virtual Programming Lab (VPL),C (programming language); Curricula; E-learning; Students; Automatic evaluation; Blended learning; Formative feedbacks; performance; Traditional learning; Virtual programming; Learning systems,"Holsapple, C.W., Lee-Post, A., Defining, assessing, and promoting e-learning success: An information systems perspective (2006) Decis.

Background Online and blended learning modes continue to grow in popularity in higher education, with the aim of streamlining and enhancing student learning, supporting collaboration and creativity, and equipping students with the skills they will require to work and live in an increasingly digitized world. This practice-based case study highlights factors which positively and negatively affect user engagement with digital learning objects and ex-plores students' perceptions of the role of online learning within their aca-demic programs. Methodology A suite of nine interactive e-tutorials, addressing essential digital literacy skills for university students, was developed through instructor and student peer collaboration using Articulate software, informed by best practice. The e-tutorials were embedded in the institutional Learning Management System for three undergraduate and postgraduate courses, in which digital literacy formed the core learning content, to complement classroom-based learning. Students in these courses were surveyed via SurveyMonkey about their specific experience of using the e-tutorials, as well as their general perceptions of digital literacy and online learning. Eighty-six students in total completed the questionnaire, which consisted of twenty-three closed- and open-ended questions. Contribution Through highlighting both the positive and the challenging aspects of the students' reported experience of online learning, this case study contrib-utes useful insights to the body of literature on user engagement with digi-tal learning objects in higher education, as well as students' perceptions and experience of blended learning. Findings The e-tutorials were perceived as valuable in reinforcing classroom learn-ing, allowing respondents to revise concepts and materials covered in face-to-face classes, at their own pace and in their own time. Survey responses showed that the accessibility, ease-of-use, design and duration of the e-tutorials were deemed effective in terms of user engagement; however, several technological challenges were identified, such as browser incompat-ibility, uneven sound quality and general Internet connection issues, which disrupted their learning. Overall, students expressed enjoyment of the learning facilitated by the e-tutorials; however, rather than favoring online learning alone, they expressed a preference for a blended learning envi-ronment, with a combination of complementary learning approaches; sur-vey respondents did not generally wish to forego face-to-face classes en-tirely. Recommendations for Practitioners Instructors should seek to strategically embed interactive digital learning objects in their courses at defined points of need in a logical structure, e.g., to reinforce classroom-based learning, or to support specific skill develop-ment. Potential disruption to learning should be minimized by following best practice guidelines to ensure ease of access, a seamless user experi-ence, and timely feedback, as well as providing adequate support for rapid resolution of technical glitches. Recommendations for Researchers E-tutorials offer a useful means of exploring ways in which students ac-quire learning in the digital environment. A wider, collaborative exploration is needed to provide comparative studies which move beyond case studies. Impact on Society Online learning mechanisms, such as e-tutorials, offer students different means of acquiring essential literacy skills and different ways to interact with content. E-tutorials constitute reusable learning objects, which can be accessed as just-in-time delivery modes, when students perceive they need to review particular skills or reinforce learning material. Future Research This research is now expanding into different types of reusable learning objects. E-tutorials may be developed in multiple ways, and comparative research around e-tutorial models will deepen our understanding of how students interact with content in formal learning contexts. As the digital educational landscape continues to expand alongside traditional face-to-face and analogue learning modes, a key research focus will be student and instructor perceptions and experience of blended learning in different con-texts. © 2019, Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice.",Blended learning; Digital literacy; E-learning; E-tutorials; Higher education; Online learning; Online tutorials,Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Human computer interaction; Sound reproduction; Surveys; Blended learning; Digital literacies; Higher education; Online learning; Online tutorials; Students,"Ademole-Odeshi, E., Attitudes of students towards e-learning in South-West Nigerian universities: An application of technology acceptance model (2014) Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal), 1035, pp. 1-18. , http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/1035; Ala-Mutka, K., Mapping digital competence: Towards a conceptual understanding (2011) JRC Technical Notes, JRC67075, , http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC67075_TN.pdf, Seville: Institute for Prospective Technological Studies; Barber, W., King, S., Teacher-student perspectives of invisible pedagogy: New directions in online problem-based learning environments (2016) The Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 14 (4), pp. 235-243. , www.ejel.org/issue/download.html?idArticle=509; Bawden, D., Information and digital literacies: A review of concepts (2001) Journal of Documentation, 57 (2), pp. 218-259. , https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007083; Bawden, D., Origins and concepts of digital literacy (2008) Digital litera-cies: Concepts, policies and practices, pp. 17-32. , http://pages.ucsd.edu/~bgoldfarb/comt109w10/reading/Lankshear-Knobel_et_al-DigitalLiteracies.pdf, In C.

The systematic review through PRISMA, sought to answer three research questions: First, how have publications evolved from 2000 to 2016 in blended learning in higher education? Secondly, what themes are frequently published in blended learning since 2000 to 2016? Thirdly, what are the emerging sub-themes in the blended learning publications in higher education? A thematic result is presented indicating major trends (in order of frequency: highest to lowest) in the Instructional design, Disposition, Exploration, Learner Outcomes, Comparison, Technology, Interactions, Professional Development, Demographic, and Others. The authors are of the view that this article contributes to the understanding and knowledge of the current research trends in blended learning and ascertains that much has to be done in terms of Blended Learning frameworks. © Copyright 2018, IGI Global.",Blended Learning; Blended Learning Framework; Collaborative Web Technologies; Higher Education,Blended learning; Collaborative webs; Higher education; Instructional designs; Professional development; Research questions; Research trends; Systematic Review; Education,"Abraham, A., (2007) Student-centred Teaching of Accounting to Engineering Students: Comparing Blended Learning and Traditional Approaches, , Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education.

All this time, in the face-to-face method of learning process, students have not been able to optimize the mastery of knowledge and skills as expected. One of the things that the Information Systems Study Program did to optimize said mastery is applying the blended learning program in e-Procurement courses. This study uses mixed method evaluation approach in evaluating various stages of the process to implement a blended learning program. Meanwhile, the evaluation method used consists of 2 parts of the model namely 1) CIPP, an evaluation carried out on context, input, process, and product, 2) The Flashlight Triad, an evaluation of activities that utilize information technology online. As the final result of evaluating the implementation of blended learning based on observations and research that has been done, there is an optimization of the increase in mastery of students' knowledge and skills, after conducting various activities that are conditioned on face-to-face activities combined with online ones. The results of this evaluation mean that a well-conditioned blended learning program can influence students in terms of motivation, therefore mastering the knowledge and skills of a course can be optimized through the student learning experience. © 2018 Authors.",Blended learning; Conditioned; Evaluation of mastery; Knowledge; Learning process; Skills,,"Zuppo, C.M., Defining ICT in a boundaryless world: The development of a working hierarchy (2012) International Journal of Managing Information Technology, 4 (3), pp. 13-22; Heyvaert, M., Hannes, K., Maes, B., Onghena, P., Critical appraisal of mixed methods studies (2013) Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 7 (4), pp. 302-327; Tshabalala, M., Ndeya-Ndereya, C., van der Merwe, T., Implementing blended learning at a developing university: Obstacles in the way (2014) Electronic Journal of E-learning, 12 (1), pp. 101-110; Maarop, A.H., Embi, M.A., Implementation of blended learning in higher learning institutions: A review of literature (2016) International Education Studies, 9 (3), pp. 41-52; Singh, H., Building effective blended learning programs (2003) Educational Technology, 43 (6), pp. 51-54; Day, J.

A total of 119 students constituted the working group of research who are attending Science Education, Turkish Education and Primary Education departments at Kilis 7 Aralık University Muallim Rifat Faculty of Education in the fall term of 2017-2018 academic years. Within the scope of the research, three groups were formed; two of them were experimental and one was control group. Flipped classroom was used in experimental group-I, blended learning method was used in experimental group-II and traditional approach was used in control group. ""Computer self-efficacy scale"" and ""self-regulation scale"" have been used for data collection tools which have been applied to the students. Descriptive statistics, t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the obtained data. There was no significant difference between the computer self-efficacy perceptions and self-regulation skills of the students in experiment-I, experiment-II and control groups after nine weeks of research.

Methodology This study employed a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design consisting of two groups: the treatment condition (sections in which instructors imple-mented the flipped classroom model for the module that was the focus of the study) and control condition (sections in which instructors lectured in the face-to-face meeting, then learners completed the practice online as homework). Learners in each group received their form of instruction and completed the same instructional activities, tests, and surveys. These data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Analysis of Covari-ance (ANACOVA) models. Contribution This research adds to a growing base of literature on the flipped classroom, a special instantiation of blended learning. Findings Results indicated that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of learner achievement. In terms of learner satisfaction, how-ever, there was a significant difference in which participants favored the control condition. Recommendations for Practitioners Practitioners should select situations that are appropriate for the flipped class-room context. This should be reflected in the implementation of curriculum that would benefit from the affordances of this approach. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers should seek to replicate this study in longer durations and using rigorously developed and validated measures. Impact on Society This study suggests the flipped classroom may not be perceived by learners in an introductory technology literacy course as beneficial to their satisfaction. Future Research Future research should seek to replicate studies in technology literacy courses to identify the optimal learning situations for the blended learning environment. © 2018 Sommer, M., and Ritzhaupt, A.",Blended learning; Flipped classroom; Learner achievement; Learner satisfaction; Technology literacy,Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Teaching; Blended learning; Blended learning environments; Descriptive statistics; Flipped classrooms; Instructional activities; Learner achievement; Learner satisfactions; Technology literacy course; Analysis of variance (ANOVA),"Adams-Becker, S., Cummins, M., Davis, A., Freeman, A., Hall Giesinger, C., Ananthanarayanan, V., (2017) NMC horizon report: 2017 higher education edition, , Austin, Texas: The New Media Consortium; Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Garrett, R., (2007) Blending in, , http://sloanconsortium.org/sites/default/files/Blending_In.pdf, The extent and promise of blended education in the United States.

More and more of these programmes and courses are designed as blended learning and are characterised by a short time cycle of design, delivery and completion. Despite a recent addition of learning design expertise to the organisation, there is a predominant tendency in design processes to focus on the technical setup, the content and the participants, and very little on the role of the teachers. The teachers’ role is challenged by a number of issues in relation to the growing use of blended and online learning, e.g. the task of facilitating the learning processes of the participants in new ways; a higher degree of exposure as the teacher often becomes the sole point of contact in online environments; communication skills needed to facilitate dialogue and collaboration in an online environment; etc. Furthermore, involvement of teaching staff in co-creation of new learning designs require skills which many lecturers do not have when they enter the design team for the first time, among others skills to articulate their pedagogical principles and technological imagination. Over time, we in our roles as learning designers in the School of Continuing Education have developed, tested and refined a technique for user involvement in the design work, and teachers now work with our professional learning designer and course producer on redesigning courses or creating new module or courses. In these collaborative design processes, we have identified a number of challenges, which will be dealt with in our paper. © 2018 The Author(s).",Blended learning; Collaborative design; Continuing education; Learning design; Role of the teacher; Short programs,,"Beetham, H., Sharpe, R., (2007) Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age: Designing and Delivering E-Learning, , Routledge, London: New York; Britain, S., A Review of Learning Design: Concept (2004) Specifications and Tools, , Report for the JISC E-learning Pedagogy Programme; Buus, L., The learning potentials and challenges when integrating Web 2.0 in a problem-based learning approach (2015) Aalborg Univeristy; Christensen, O., Christiansen, R.B., Gynther, K., Helms, N.H., Schlüntz, D., (2014) Kan Vi lære Af De Andre? – Udenlandske Erfaringer Med e-læring Og Blended Learning I Erhvervsuddannelser Og læreruddannelser for erhvervsskolelærere, , University College Sjælland; Conole, G., (2013) Designing for Learning in an Open World, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-8517-0, Springer: New York, NY; Conole, G., Describing learning activities-Tools and resources to guide practice (2007) In: Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age: Designing and Delivering E-Learning, pp. 81-91. , Routledge, New York: London; Dohn, N.B., Teaching with wikis and blogs: Potentials and pitfalls (2010) Proceedings of the 7Th International Conference on Networked Learning.

The flipped classroom model emerges in this context to address the limitations of the traditional classroom. When successfully implemented, it can provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace and to develop self-learning competences that are useful both academically and professionally. This paper proposes a methodology for the effective deployment of the flipped classroom that aims to assist educators in their efforts to flip their classrooms. The methodology comprises five core aspects: pre-class content delivery, pre-class assessment, in-class content review, classroom active learning and in-class assessment. © 2018 IADIS Press.

The model aims to support discussions around domains such as how institutions are prepared, the participants' background and expectations, the course design, and the learning process. The research that supported the design of this model was framed by a Grounded Theory method, combining different approaches to empirical data collection with a review of evaluation models on aspects of the quality of Online and Distance Learning. Throughout the paper, arguments are made that Higher Education institutions need to be more critical with regard to the use of Technology-Enhanced Learning, and to support it as a counterpart to face-to-face learning and teaching. The model provides a framework for teachers in Higher Education to reflect and discuss the quality of Technology-Enhanced Learning in their Blended Learning programmes.

This article reports on the current experience of a higher education institution embarking on blended learning models. The aim of this article is to present a case study and to discuss the strategic approach to integrating a MOOC at undergraduate level. The evaluation strategy of this experience uses surveys and focus groups to interpret the results and the perspective of the various stakeholders. The analysis synthesizes the opinion of the main stakeholders - the institution, the students and the academic staff - and shows that in addition to improving the financial viability of MOOCs, blended learning models improve the quality of students' education, strengthen students' academic performance, and encourage academic staff to constantly innovate their teaching and learning process.

As the demand for online learning grows, it is critical that tertiary education institutes (TEIs) address gaps in knowledge by developing their understandings of EOT applications. This paper aimed to identify, and describe the application of a range of EOTs popularly used in blended tertiary environments (BTEs). Through qualitatively designed semi-structured interviews with 13 blended learning experts from New Zealand, Australia and Canada, and a 5-step analyses of data, it verified the use of 35 different EOTs in BTEs, including Adobe Connect, Blackboard, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Their key characteristics were summarised using a multi-dimensional taxonomy, called the Pentexonomy, which synergised a range of perspectives into a robust, contextualised, and multidimensional framework for categorising EOTs. An outline of recommendations for the effective use of some of these EOTs was also provided. As EOTs advance and usage accelerates, the outcomes of this research will assist TEIs in their efforts to keep abreast of EOT developments, make informed choices about EOT use, and contribute to the delivery of relevant, meaningful EOT support.

Amity being a pioneer in synergizing ICT into teaching-learning methodology started its Flipped Classroom implementation. The entire Flipped Classroom Model (FCM) aims at creating a Learner-Centric classroom, rather than traditional teacher-centric education system. It was implemented with selective seven institutions and nineteen subjects. The Flipped Classroom Coordinators (FCC) were diligently selected, designated and trained upon with the basic essentials. Each FCC in turn contributed to numerous brainstorming sessions to identify the subjects. The SMEs and Instructional designers have developed a robust ""content development plan"", which served as a backbone for the content development (Multimedia and Textual) of the nineteen selected subjects. Faculty were introduced and motivated towards the new formats of presentation and assessment patterns of FCM. The developed videos/electronic learning materials and textual contents were uploaded in the Learning Management System (LMS) and learners were provided access through the University Management System. The authors have made an attempt to create an implementation framework for Flipped Classrooms based on their experience of FCM deployment at Amity University, Noida. The impact of this model on the learning experience of learners and its effect on faculty's role will be analyzed keeping their performance and actual learning outcomes as reference to create a generic framework. © 2017 ACM.",Blended Learning; Flipped Classroom Model (FCM); Green Learning; ICT-based learning; Inverted Learning,Education; Education computing; Government data processing; Green computing; Teaching; Blended learning; Flipped Classroom Model (FCM); Green learning; ICT-based learning; Inverted Learning; Learning systems,"Ash, K., Educators view 'flipped' model with a more critical eye (2012) Education Week, 32 (2), p.

Our study assesses the response of one higher education institution (HEI) to the changing digital landscape and its transition into enhanced blended learning, which seeks to go beyond the early implementation stage to make the most effective use of online learning technologies to enhance the student experience and student learning outcomes. Evidence from a qualitative study comprising 20 semi-structured interviews, informed by a literature review, has resulted in the development of a holistic framework to guide HEIs transitioning into enhanced blended learning. The proposed framework addresses questions relating to the why (change agents), what (institutional considerations), how (organisational preparedness) and who (stakeholders) of transitions into enhanced blended learning. The involvement of all stakeholder groups is essential to a successful institutional transition into enhanced blended learning. © 2017, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

During 2012 and 2013, our University adopted MOOC-like technologies to support some of these courses so that a blended learning methodology could be applied in a particular educational context, i.e. by using SPOCs (Small Private Online Courses). This paper gathers a list of issues, challenges and solutions when implementing these SPOCs. Based on these challenges and issues, a design process is proposed for the implementation of SPOCs. In addition, an evaluation is presented of the different use of the offered courses based on indicators such as the number of videos accessed, number of exercises accessed, number of videos completed, number of exercises correctly solved or time spent on the platform. © J.UCS.",Evaluation; Learning experiences; Learning platforms; MOOCs; Remedial education; SPOCs,,"Breslow, L.B., Pritchard, D.E., Deboer, J., Stump, G.S., Ho, A.D., Seaton, D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edX’s first MOOC (2013) Research & Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25; Clow, D., The learning analytics cycle: Closing the loop effectively (2012) In Proc. of the Learning Analytics Conference, pp. 134-138. , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2330636; Combéfis, S., Bibal, A., Van Roy, P., Recasting a Traditional Course into a MOOC by Means of a SPOC (2014) Proc.

The course was based on the principles of distance learning; it utilised the opensource learning management system - Moodle, and it was implemented as an action research project for three consecutive semesters (2014-2016). Its pedagogical aim was to investigate a prototype model of digital learning: the 'interactive evaluation' that was embodied in the design of the e-course and in the cycles of action research. Acting as creators, teachers and researchers in order to investigate the student-evaluators' perceptions of the e-course, we attempted to 'produce' wider knowledge of the assessment criteria within the context of blended education. In particular, the how and why specific learning criteria and critical approach to knowledge can be organised as more general constructivist and student-centred indexes of the learning technology. As a case study, the research outcomes revealed factors related to expression of interest, encouragement for participation and motivation of students to infiltrate, evaluate the e-course and contribute to remodelling its educational material.

Hence, the purpose of this study is to validate a scale used to evaluate the degree to which the students perceive the five aspects of instructional design: objectives, curricular content, learning activities, educational resources, and the existing evaluation strategy at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC). Through the use of an analytical and descriptive study, as well as qualitative and quantitative techniques, a Likert evaluation scale was designed. According to the results, the final version of the instrument consisted of 33 items and had a confidence coefficient of 0.923. In regards to the evidence associated to its validity, it was possible to verify the representability and relevance of the instructional design components and their factorial structure. The main conclusion obtained from this study is the importance of measuring, from a systemic perspective, the instructional design components, in classroom, blended learning and virtual courses with tools that are properly validated in order to guarantee the confidence level and valid interpretation of the results. © 2016, The Author(s).",Higher education; Instructional design; Learning environments; Validation,,"Arjona, M., Blando, M., (2007) Diseño Instruccional, elemento clave en el desarrollo de cursos para Ambientes Virtuales de Aprendizaje, , http://bibliotecadigital.conevyt.org.mx/colecciones/documentos/somece/51.pdf; Bates, T., Sangrà, A., (2011) Managing technology in higher education: Strategies for transforming teaching and learning, , John Wiley & Sons, San Francisco; Berger, C., Kam, R., (1996) Education 626: Educational Software Design and Authoring, , http://www.umich.edu/~ed626/define.html; Bernard, R.M., Abrami, P.C., Lou, Y., Borokhovski, E., Wade, A., Wozney, L., Fiset, M., Huang, B., How does distance education compare to classroom instruction?

Courses disseminated are either fully online or on a blended learning mode. While the growth rate of online learning is higher compared to the traditional mode, we also find that online learners lack the pedagogical support to help them pursue successfully their studies online. With a growing feeling of isolation due to lack of interaction online, they end up withdrawing from the course. Whereby the necessity to develop an online learning environment to meet the pedagogical needs of students. In support to higher education institutions, learning management systems (LMS) provide the core learning platforms for an online environment. However to assess how effective an online learning environment is, universities need to measure how well these LMS deliver their key functions and fulfill the pedagogical needs of learners online. This paper explores initially the perceptions of learners following the use of Moodle as well as the barriers they face. This exploratory study was conducted through a web survey to learners engaged in blended learning. Once the data was collected and analyzed, with the use of the Community of Inquiry Framework, which is considered as the model which provides insights to the dimensions of an effective online learning environment, we explored how effective the main functionalities and tools available on Moodle provided the pedagogical supports students needed online. Overall results show that students use Moodle to access notes rather than as an online learning environment where interaction between peers and instructor should have been done. The mapping results show that modules are present on Moodle to support learners in their studies. However the functionalities and tools need to be used fully to be beneficial. © 2016 IEEE.",community of inquiry framework; learning management systems; moodle; online learning,Computer aided instruction; Education; Education computing; Learning systems; Online systems; Societies and institutions; Students; Teaching; Community of inquiry; Higher education institutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning management system; moodle; Online learning; Online learning environment; Pedagogical supports; E-learning,"Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Changing course: Ten years of tracking online education in the United States (2013) Nurs.

Although this learning mode is not new in higher education, little research has been done to contextualise social presence experiences in which effects of interactions were explored for enhancing learning. A qualitative approach was adopted using the case study method to examine the instructor and students’ pedagogic interactions in the social presence of a blended synchronous learning environment. This paper reports an exploration of the blended learning with an online group of students at a remote site attending a computer-aided engineering drawing course synchronously with a face-to-face group taught by an instructor in a laboratory. The process of interaction was visually and verbally mediated by videoconference as if in an online face-to-face learning community. The findings show that the online and face-to-face groups had different social presence experiences in which interaction emerged. Emotional adaptation and practice is needed for the students and the instructor in such a complex environment. Based on the interaction patterns, a framework of interactions in the blended synchronous learning environment is conceptualised to inform course development and instructional design. Implications for further study are also discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",blended synchronous learning; face-to-face teaching; interactions; online learning; social presence; virtual environment,,"Akyol, Z., Arbaugh, J.B., Cleveland-Innes, M., Garrison, D.R., Ice, P., Richardson, J.C., Swan, K., A response to the review of the community of inquiry framework (2009) Journal of Distance Education, 23 (2), pp. 123-136; Akyol, Z., Garrison, D.R., Understanding cognitive presence in an online and blended community of inquiry: Assessing outcomes and processes for deep approaches to learning (2011) British Journal of Educational Technology, 42 (2), pp. 233-250; Bassey, M., On the nature of research in education (part 2) (1990) Research Intelligence, 37 (Summer), pp. 39-44; Bianco, M.B., Carr-Chellman, A.A., Exploring qualitative methodologies in online learning environments (2007) Online learning community, pp. 299-317. , Luppicini R., (ed), Charlotte, NC: IAP; Bonk, C.J., Graham, C.R., (2006) The handbook of blended learning: Global perspectives, local designs, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Chen, N.-S., Ko, H.-C., Kinshuk, Lin, T., A model for synchronous learning using the Internet (2005) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 42 (2), pp. 181-194; Cobb, S.C., Social presence and online learning: A current view from a research perspective (2009) Journal of Interactive Online Learning, 8 (3), pp. 241-254; Cohen, J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20 (1), pp. 37-46; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., (2003) E-learning in the 21st century, , London: RoutedgeFalmer; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., Archer, W., Critical inquiry in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education (2000) The Internet and Higher Education, 2 (2-3), pp. 87-105; Garrison, D.R., Cleveland-Innes, M., Facilitating cognitive presence in online learning: Interaction is not enough (2005) The American Journal of Distance Education, 19 (3), pp. 133-148; Garrison, D.R., Vaughan, N.D., (2008) Blended learning in higher education: Framework, principles, and guidelines, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Gregori, E., Torras, E., Guasch, T., Cognitive attainment in online learning environments: Matching cognitive and technological presence (2012) Interactive Learning Environments, 20 (5), pp. 467-483; Gunawardena, C.N., Social presence theory and implications for interaction and collaborative learning in computer conferences (1995) International Journal of Education Telecommunications, 1 (2-3), pp. 147-166; Gunawardena, C.N., Zittle, F.J., Social presence as a predictor of satisfaction with a computer-mediated conferencing environment (1997) American Journal of Distance Education, 11, pp. 8-26; Hastie, M., Hung, I.-C., Chen, N.-S., Kinshuk, A blended synchronous learning model for educational international collaboration (2010) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 47 (1), pp. 9-24; Kreijns, K., Kirschner, P.A., Jochems, W., Identifying the pitfalls for social interaction in computer-supported collaborative learning environments: A review of the research (2003) Computers in Human Behavior, 19 (3), pp. 335-353; Kreijns, K., Kirschner, P.A., Jochems, W., Measuring perceived social presence in distributed learning groups (2011) Education Information Technology, 16 (4), pp. 365-381; Lawson, T., Comber, C., Gage, J., Cullum-Hanshaw, A., Images of the future for education?

Dialogic learning was introduced to a unit of study taken by a final-year cohort of students in an initial teacher education degree at an urban university in Australia. Various opportunities for dialogue were designed into the unit through blended learning such as face-to-face tutorials, social networks and Viva Voce contexts. In the face of mixed opinion on their efficacy, the author profiles the use of social networks as a means of incorporating more interactive discourse through Web 2.0 platforms in higher education. The mixed-methods study reports on data collected from focus group interviews run at the end of the semester. An analytical framework based on Alexander’s principles of dialogic learning is used to interrogate the data set. The results illustrate the positive impact that dialogue employed as a pedagogic tool had on the value students perceived of their learning experience. It is recommended that designs for learning in higher education incorporate iterative exchanges across a variety of blended learning contexts to encourage productive interactions between students, peers and tutors. © 2015 Alyson Simpson.",blended learning; dialogic learning; higher education; pedagogy; social networks,,"Ahola, S., (2000) Hidden curriculum in higher education – Something to fear for or comply to?, , Paper presented at the Innovations in Higher Education conference, Helsinki, Finland:; Alexander, R., (2000) Culture and pedagogy: International comparisons of primary education, , London: Blackwell; Alexander, R., (2004) Towards dialogic teaching: Rethinking classroom talk, , 4th ed., Cambridge: Dialogos; Alexander, R., Towards a comparative pedagogy (2009) International handbook of comparative education, pp. 923-942. , Cowen R., Kazamias A.M., (eds), London: Springer; (2012) National professional standards for teachers and the initial teacher education standards and guidelines, , http://www.teacherstandards.aitsl.edu.au/OrganisationStandards/Organisation; Barnes, D., Why talk is important (2010) English Teaching: Practice and Critique, 9 (2), pp. 7-10; Barron, B., When smart groups fail (2003) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 12, pp. 307-359; Bell, F., The agency of students, teachers and learning technologists (2009) ALT-J, Research in Learning Technology, 17 (2), pp. 73-74; Christie, F., (2002) Classroom discourse analysis: A functional perspective, , London: Continuum; Deng, L., Yuen, A., Blogs in pre-service teacher education: Exploring the participation issue (2013) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 22, pp. 339-356; Ellis, R.A., Calvo, R.A., Learning through discussions in blended environments (2004) Educational Media International, 41, pp. 263-274; Friesen, N., Lowe, S., The questionable promise of social media for education: Connective learning and the commercial imperative (2012) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 28, pp. 183-194; Hung, H., Yuen, S., Educational use of social networking technology in higher education (2010) Teaching in Higher Education, 15, pp. 703-714; Kirkwood, A., E-learning: You don't always get what you hope for (2009) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 18, pp. 107-121; Kreijns, K., Kirschner, P., Jochems, W., Identifying the pitfalls for social interaction in computer-supported collaborative learning environments: A review of the research (2003) Computers in Human Behavior, 19, pp. 335-353; Larivee, B., Transforming teaching practice: Becoming the critically reflective teacher (2000) Reflective Practice, 1, pp. 293-307; Lave, J., Wenger, E., (1991) Situated learning: Legitimate peripheral participation, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Lemke, J.L., Critical analysis across media: Games, franchises, and the new cultural order (2005) Approaches to critical discourse analysis, , Postigo L., (ed), Valencia: University of Valencia, CD-ROM; Love, K., Simpson, A., Online discussions in schools: Towards a pedagogical framework (2006) International Journal of Educational Research, 43, pp. 446-463; Luke, A., Critical literacy in Australia: A matter of context and standpoint (2000) Journal of Adult and Adolescent Literacy, 43, pp. 448-461; Mercer, N., (1995) The guided construction of knowledge: Talk amongst teachers and learners, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Mercer, N., (2000) Words and minds: How we use language to think together, , London: Routledge; Mercer, N., Sociocultural discourse analysis: Analysing classroom talk as a social mode of thinking (2004) Journal of Applied Linguistics, 1, pp. 137-168; Mercer, N., Littleton, K., Wegerif, R., Methods for studying the processes of interaction and collaborative activity in computer-based educational activities (2004) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 13, pp. 195-212; Merriam, S.B., (2001) Qualitative research and case study applications in education, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Michell, M., Sharpe, T., Collective instructional scaffolding in English as a Second Language classrooms (2005) Prospect, 20, pp. 31-58; Noor Al-Deen, H., Hendricks, J., (2012) Social media usage and impact, , Plymouth: Lexington Books; Owen, M., Just a tool?

First, the importance of a flexible, curriculum-based approach to BL is examined, based on a review of the literature. Experimentation with blended English language courses for part-time students began in 2002 and in 2005 the open-source learning platform, Moodle, was adopted due to the interactive tools available, making it possible to create learner-centered activities based on a collaborative approach. A description is given of the role BL has played in adult professional training at the university and how it provides a flexible solution for meeting the needs of degree course programs for students. With a view toward good practice, a detailed description of a currently offered blended course is given, including comparative data of the same course taught traditionally in the classroom with results indicating student performance for both courses during the period of an academic year. Moreover, a range of competencies is necessary to prepare students for the workplace, such as providing them with skills in intercultural communication and digital literacies, which can be indirect benefits from the adoption of a blended methodology. The study concludes with reflections for the future. © 2016, Italian e-Learning Association.

To conduct a quantitative comparison of the contents of all notes for effective instruction from lecturer to students to occur, the contents were mathematically compared and evaluated using two ways of summarizing the frequency of term co-occurrences. In order to evaluate visually the differences between the contents of notes taken, an adjacency matrix and Levenshtein distance metrics were employed to represent noun co-occurrence in the notes. In comparing notes between the lecturer and students, insufficient distance and additional distance are defined and measured for all participants during the course. In the results, students recorded additional nouns to replace the nouns given by the lecturer, and introduced new nouns of their own as substitutes as well. There are significant correlation relationships between the above mentioned distances and the ratios, such as between the word ratio and coverage, which have been defined in previous studies. Also, summarizing ways of co-occurrence frequency did not affect any of the relationships. Finally, possible applications for visualizing learning activities of the lecturer and students are discussed. © 2016, IGI Global.",Adjacency matrix; Blended learning; Distance; Note assessment; Term co-occurrence,Computer aided instruction; Education; Students; Teaching; Adjacency matrices; Blended learning; Distance; Note assessment; Term co-occurrence; Quality control,"IGraph: Network analysis and visualization, , http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html, iGraph [online] Available; Jackson, P., Moulinier, I., (2002) Natural Language Processing for Online Applications -Text Retrieval, Extraction and Categorization, , Amsterdam, Netherlands: John Benjamins Publishing; Jin, M., (2009) Tekisuto Deta No Tokei Kagaku Nyumon, , Tokyo, Japan: Iwanami Shoten; Kiewra, K.A., Students' note-taking behaviors and the efficacy of providing the instructor's notes for review (1985) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 10 (4), pp. 378-386; Kiewra, K.A., A review of note-taking: The encoding-storage paradigm and beyond (1989) Educational Psychology Review, 1 (2), pp. 147-172; Kiewra, K.A., Benton, S.L., Kim, S.-I., Risch, N., Christensen, M., Effects of note-taking format and study technique on recall and relational performance (1995) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 20 (2), pp. 172-187; Kobayashi, K., What limits the encoding effect of note-taking?

The framework also identified key strategy, structure, and support issues universities may address at each stage. In this paper, the authors applied that framework as well as Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovations theory to determine the degree to which institutional strategy, structure, and support measures facilitate or impede BL adoption among higher education faculty. In addition, the authors explored whether higher education faculty's innovation adoption category affects which measures facilitate or impede BL adoption. To achieve these objectives, the authors surveyed 214 faculty and interviewed 39 faculty at a school in the adoption/early implementation stage of BL adoption. The authors published the survey results in a prior article.

To gain knowledge about the ways in which the tutors experienced the phenomenon, a phenomenographic methodological framework was employed. Identified were four different ways of conceiving the online course as: A) a one-way street of communication: to provide students with extra materials to practice individually and for asynchronous communication, B) an add-on to on-campus classes; C) a distant relationship between students and online tutors; and D) an opportunity for tutor's professional development and team communication. The phenomenographic approach allowed to reveal variations of tutors' perceptions of teaching online with a view of enhancing the university curriculum.

The model development is based on survey data collected from representative teachers and students studying in higher education institutions in Turkey. To develop the model, the study investigated the attitudes of the representative key stakeholders in the relevant higher education institutions towards e-learning by administrating questionnaires and interviews with teachers and students. The responses of the teachers and students were then compared. Based on the results, a model was proposed with a multidimensional approach to e-learning. The model ips electrical engineering to make sure that the students review, discuss, and explore course content before and after class. The proposed model encourages students to start with e-learning, to continue with the face-to-face learning setting on campus, and then to come back to e- learning for evaluating their learning in the classroom. Using this model, students can study at home and assess their learning before and after their attendance to campus lectures and enhance their learning with various types of learning, namely self-directed learning, self-assessment, teacher-directed learning, teacher assessment, computer-directed learning, and computer assessment. Similarly, model evaluation was conducted at the relevant higher education institutions. To evaluate the applicability of the model, a case-control study was conducted to determine whether the model had the intended effect on the participating students of the relevant institutions. As a result of the case-control study, the effects of e-learning, blended learning, and traditional learning were verified by teaching the use of MATLAB software. The overall scores indicated that e-learning and blended learning were more effective as compared to traditional learning. The results of our study indicated that the knowledge increase in e-learners seemed to be gradual because they tended to study daily by completing each activity on time. © 2016 TÜBİTAK.",E-learning; E-learning readiness; Educational game; Electricity; Higher education,Curricula; E-learning; Education; Education computing; Electricity; MATLAB; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Teaching; E-learning readiness; Educational game; Face-to-face learning; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Multi-dimensional approach; Self-directed learning; Traditional learning; Engineering education,"Martín-Rodríguez, O., Fernández-Molina, J.S., Montero-Alonso, M.A., González-Gómez, F., The main components of satisfaction with e-learning (2014) J Technol Pedagog Educ, 23, pp. 1-11; Laurillard, D., Technology, pedagogy and education: Concluding comments (2007) J Technol Pedagog Educ, 16, pp. 357-360; Hughes, G., Using blended learning to increase learner support and improve retention (2007) J Teac High Educ, 12, pp. 349-363; Zappe, S., Leicht, R., Messner, J., Litzinger, T., Lee, H.W., 'Flipping' the classroom to explore active learning in a large undergraduate course (2009) ASEE 2009 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exhibition, pp. 1-21. , 14-17 June; Austin, Texas, USA; Lage, J.M., Platt, J.G., Treglia, M., Inverting the classroom: A gateway to creating an inclusive learning environment (2000) J Econ Educ, 31, pp. 30-43; Akaslan, D., Law, E.L.C., Measuring teachers' readiness for e-learning in higher education institutions associated with the subject of electricity in Turkey (2011) IEEE 2011 Global Engineering Education Conference, pp. 481-490. , 4-6 April; Amman, Jordan.

For this reason, a new approach has been considered in Aerospace Engineering at Technical University of Valencia (UPV) which, in addition to master classes, includes assignments specially designed to achieve mathematical competencies in the first year. These assignments reinforce the learning process of students and increase their competencies before each assessment test. On the other hand PoliformaT, an educational platform developed by UPV, and based on the Sakai project, has facilitated to develop a flipped teaching methodology in the one hour lab sessions in the first year of Aerospace Engineering. Thus a blended learning methodology, a combination of computer technologies and face-to-face classes, has provided very good learning outcomes results for Spanish standards. We present some results concerning our first year Mathematics course in Aerospace Engineering and the opinion of the students about this blended learning methodology. © 2015 IEEE.",Assessment and Evaluation Strategies/Approaches Laboratory Experiences; Blended learning; First and Second Year Program; Mathematics in Engineering Education; Teaching & Learning Experiences in Engineering Education,Aerospace engineering; Learning systems; Students; Blended learning; Digital technologies; Educational platforms; First and Second Year Program; Laboratory experiences; Learning experiences; Teaching methodologies; Technical universities; Engineering education,"Croisier, D., Purser, L., Smidt, H., Trends V: Universities shaping the european higher education area (2007) EUA Report; Edwards, M., Sánchez Ruiz, L.M., Sánchez Díaz, C., Achieving competence-based curriculum in engineering education in Spain (2009) Proceedings of the IEEE, 97 (10), pp. 1727-1736; (2015), http://www.upv.es/titulaciones/GIA/menu_812584i.html, Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering, Last accessed March; (2015), https://www.sakaiproject.org, Sakai, Last Accessed March; (2015), http://turnitin.com/es, Turnintin, Last Accessed 15 March; Bergmann, J., Sams, A., Before you flip, consider this (2012) Phi Delta Kappan, 94 (2), p. 25; Bergmann, J., Overmyer, J., Wilie, B., The flipped class: What it is and what it is not (2015) The Daily Riff, , http://www.thedailyriff.com/articles/the-flipped-class-conversation-689.php, July 2013. , Last accessed 13 March; Kim, M.K., Kim, S.M., Khera, O., Getman, J., The experience of three flipped classrooms in an urban university: An exploration of design principles (2014) Internet and Higher Education, 22, pp. 37-50; Hughes, H., Introduction to flipping the college classroom Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications, pp. 2434-2438. , Chesapeake, April 2012; 7 things you need to know about flipping the classroom (2015) A White Paper from Information Technology Services at Penn State, , http://newfacultysupport.csulb.wikispaces.net/file/view/2011-Flippingthe-Classroom.pdf, The Pennsylvania State University, Last Accessed 15 March; Roselló, M.D., Transformación de Joukowski, , http://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/16813, Last Accessed 15 March 2015; Moraño, J.A., (2015) Gráficas 2D.

They are reflections of the progressive change in higher education over the last few decades towards more student-and learning centred pedagogies and practices, which are made possible through new technologies and more delivery of online and blended (combination of face-to-face and online components) courses. The increasing personalising and flexibility of learning in higher education requires equal attention spent to assessment practices to ensure a cohesive learning experience. This paper provides the findings and conclusions of a study about a flipped classroom, which also included flexible assessment components. The study showed that students enjoy and are more engaged in a flipped classroom, prefer a blended learning to a fully online learning approach, want and require clear structure and guidelines, and strongly value flexible assessment through more choices and control. The main concern of higher education teachers is the time commitment and lack of institutional support for flipping classrooms and providing flexible assessment. It is argued that personalising learning requires more personalising of assessment, and that it is mainly the responsibility of teachers and institutions to develop 'flexible students'. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Flexible assessment; Flexible learning; Flipped classroom; Higher education; Personalised learning,E-learning; Education; Social networking (online); Students; Flexible assessments; Flexible Learning; Flipped classroom; Higher education; Personalised learning; Teaching,"Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2013) Changing Course: Ten Years of Tracking Online Education in the United States, , http://sloanconsortium.org/publications/survey/changing_course_2012, Accessed 12.02.14; Biggs, J., (2003) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , 2nd ed.

Mining of LMS users' data, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic, is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer) consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of the LMS use from 75 professors and 1037 students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal dependencies representation of Moodle LMS users' QoI, revealing perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level. Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and analysis of the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of the LMS use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors and decision-makers of HEIs could be assisted to holistically visualize, understand and assess OLEs stakeholders' needs within the teaching and learning practices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the adoption of BL practices continues at a low pace due to academics' low digital fluency, various views and BL definitions, and limited standards-based tools to guide academic practice. To address these issues, this paper introduces a BL framework, based on one definition and with criteria and standards of practice to support the evaluation and advancement of BL in higher education. The framework is theoretically underpinned by the extant literature and supported by focus group discussions. The evidence supporting the criteria and standards are discussed with suggestions for how they can be used to guide course design, academic practice, and professional development. © 2015 N.

The main focus is not to explore blended learning in detail, but to consider flipped learning as a subset of blended learning. The context in which this is explored is undergraduate Higher Education. Questions this research explored included: What kind of evidence does the literature offer for the effectiveness of the flipped classroom model? What range of versions is currently found in flipped classroom case studies? What learning/educational theories underpin the flipped classroom approach? What does the flipped classroom model offer to university teachers and students which cannot be achieved in other blended formats?",Blended learning; Constructivist learning; Flipped learning; Problem based learning,E-learning; Education; Education computing; Social networking (online); Teaching; Blended learning; Constructivist learning; Critical evaluation; Development and applications; Flipped learning; Online and face-to-face learning; Problem based learning; University teachers; Students,"Bishop, J.L., Verleger, M.A., The flipped classroom: A survey of the research (2013) Conference Proceedings of American Society for Engineering Education, , Atlanta, June 2013; Bourner, T., Greener, S., Rospigliosi, A., Graduate employability and the propensity to learn in employment: A new vocationalism (2011) Higher Education Review, 43 (3), pp. 5-30; Cuseo, J., The empirical case against large class size: Adverse effects on the teaching, learning, and retention of first-year students (2007) Journal of Faculty Development, 21, pp. 5-22; Crouch, C.H., Mazur, E., Peer instruction: Ten years of experience and results (2001) American Journal of Physics, (69), pp. 970-977; Davies, R.S., Dean, D.L., Ball, N., Flipping the classroom and instructional technology integration in a college-level information systems spreadsheet course (2013) Educational Technology Research and Development, 61 (4), pp. 563-580; Davies, S., Mobile device adoption in UK higher education Teaching Innovation in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences University of Manchester, , http://www.elearning.eps.manchester.ac.uk/blog/2014/marticle-series-mobile-device-adoption-in-uk-he/, Accessed: 2/02/15; Freeman-Herreid, C., Schiller, N.A., Case studies and the flipped classroom (2013) Journal of College Science Teaching, 42 (5), pp. 62-66; Gannod, G.C., WIP: Using podcasting in an inverted classroom (2007) Proceedings of the 37th IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, p. 2007; Garrison, D.R., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) Internet and Higher Education, 7, pp. 95-105; Kaner, C., Fiedler, R., Inside out: A computer science course gets a makeover (2005) Association for Educational Communication and Technology International Conference, p. 2005; Khalaf, S., (2014) Mobile Use Grows 115% in 2013, , http://www.flurry.com/bid/103601/Mobile-Use-Grows-115-in-2013-Propelled-by-Messaging-Apps#.VNqL-UI7aFL; Lage, M.J., Platt, G., The internet and the inverted classroom (2000) The Journal of Economic Education, 31 (1), p. 11; Mazur, E., (1997) Peer Instruction: A User's Manual, , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; McLaughlin, J.E., Griffin, L.M., Esserman, D.A., Davidson, C.A., Glatt, D.M., Rother, M.T., Gharkholonarehe, N., Mumper, R.J., Pharmacy student engagement, performance, and perception in a flipped satellite classroom (2013) American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 77 (9), p. 196; Rowe, M., Frantz, J., Bozalek, V., Beyond knowledge and skills: The use of a delphi study to develop a technologymediated teaching strategy (2013) BMC Medical Education, 13 (3), p. 51; Savery, J.R., Overview of problem-based learning: Definitions and distinctions (2006) Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-Based Learning, 1 (1). , http://dx.doi.org/10.7771/1541-5015.1002; Smith, M.K., Wood, W.B., Krauter, K., Knight, J.K., Combining peer discussion with instructor explanation increases student learning from in-class concept questions (2011) Cell Biology Education, 10 (1), pp. 55-63; Strayer, J., How learning in an inverted classroom influences cooperation, innovation and task orientation (2012) Learning Environments Research, 15 (2), p. 171; Talbert, R., LearningMATLAB in the inverted classroom (2012) Proceedings of the ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, p. 2012; Toto, R., Nguyen, H., Flipping the work design in an industrial engineering course (2009) Frontiers in Education Conference, 2009. 39th IEEE, pp. 1-4. , IEEE, 2009; Willey, K., Gardener, A., (2013) Flipping Your Classroom Without Flipping Out, , Leuven, Belgium, 41st SEFI Conference; Yarbro, J., Arfstrom, K.M., McKnight, K., McKnight, P., (2014) Extension of A Review of Flipped Learning, , http://www.flippedlearning.org/cms/lib07/VA01923112/Centricity/Domain/41/Extension%20of%20FLipped%20Learning%20LIt%20Review%20June%202014.pdf, Flipped Learning Network, Accessed 6/2/15; Zhang, D., Zhou, L., Briggs, R.O., Nunamaker, J.F., Instructional video in e-learning: Assessing the impact of interactive video on learning effectiveness (2006) Information & Management, 43 (1), pp. 15-27; Zhao, Y., Ho, A.D., (2014) Evaluating the Flipped Classroom in An Undergraduate History Course, , HarvardX Research Memo",20488882,9781910810255,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940669765

This methodological study investigates the impact of the provision of lecture choice (online or f2f) on overall student achievement and course engagement. This research uses a within-group design to obtain baseline data on a single set of physics students (n=168), and investigates the impact of providing a lecture viewing choice (online, f2f) mid-semester on student achievement (tests, homework, and standardized conceptual evaluation scores), and course engagement (student lecture viewing, homework submissions, bonus project submissions, and note taking behaviors). The study reveals that the type of lecture does not serve to significantly impact overall student achievement or engagement. However, although recorded and f2f lectures demonstrate an overall educationally equivalent impact, students who elect a high level of recorded lecture use were significantly lower performing and less engaged before the option to watch recorded lectures was introduced and largely continued to be so after the option was introduced, but there was evidence of a reduction in achievement and engagement differences after the option is introduced. Therefore, results of this study suggest weaker performing students self-select higher levels of recorded lecture use, and the use of these video lectures may assist this specific group of students in closing the gap between themselves and students who were initially higher performing and more engaged. © 2015 Sloan Consortium.

Additional research is needed to guide institutions of higher education in strategically adopting and implementing blended learning on campus. The authors conducted a prior study in which they proposed a framework for institutional BL adoption (Graham, Woodfield, & Harrison, 2012), identifying three stages: (1) awareness/exploration, (2) adoption/early implementation, and (3) mature implementation/growth. The framework also identified key strategy, structure, and support issues universities may address at each stage. The current study applies this adoption framework to 11 U. S. institutions participating in a Next Generation Learning Challenge (NGLC) grant and attempting to transition from an awareness/ exploration of BL to the adoption/early implementation phase. The study also compares U.S. institutional strategy, structure, and support approaches to BL adoption and identifies patterns and distinctions. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Distance education and telelearning; Post-secondary education; Teaching/learning strategies,Adoption framework; Blended learning; Distance education and tele-learning; Higher education; Institutional strategy; Institutions of higher educations; Postsecondary education; Teaching/learning strategy; Distance education; Societies and institutions,"Al-Sarrani, N., (2010) Concerns and Professional Development Needs of Science Faculty at Taibah University in Adopting Blended Learning, , (Doctoral dissertation).

This paper reports on an investigation into the use of a blended learning approach to teaching and learning of programming in a class of more than 200 students. A course and learning environment was designed by integrating constructivist learning models of Constructive Alignment, Conversational Framework and the Three-Stage Learning Model. Design science research is used for the course redesign and development of the learning environment, and action research is integrated to undertake participatory evaluation of the intervention. The action research involved the Students' Approach to Learning survey, a comparative analysis of students' performance, and qualitative data analysis of data gathered from various sources. The paper makes a theoretical contribution in presenting a design of a blended learning solution for large class teaching of programming grounded in constructivist learning theory and use of free and open source technologies. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",blended learning; constructivist learning; large class teaching; programming,,"Apple, D.K., Nelson, D., Identification of non-success factors in a large introductory computer science course and constructive interventions for increasing student success (2002) 32nd Annual Frontiers in Education, 2002.

Therefore, educational programs that offer alternative class meeting times and other flexible options are attractive to the nontraditional student. The purpose of this paper is to describe and demonstrate a model for a graduate program delivered by a hybrid, or blended, format. The model will be a master's degree program in exercise and nutrition science where the program is deli'mered through blending both face to face classroom learning and e-learning teaching methodologies. Challenges of development, lessons learned, and future recommendations will also be presented.

However, many university teachers are having difficulties in designing effective learning instructions or activities for a flipped course. Aiming to explore the validity of the flipped learning concept in a higher education context, an innovative flipped course was designed and implemented using an advanced learning platform to create a holistic flipped classroom environment. A survey, an interview, and computer system logs were used to evaluate the effectiveness of such a pedagogical method. It was found that the 'Holistic Flipped Classroom' approach was effective: students reported that they were satisfied with the course, their attendance improved, and their study efforts increased. It was also found that the transactional distance changed during the learning process: highly motivated students performed much better comparatively than less motivated ones. Although this approach has shown positive results, some students retained their former passive learning habits, and this became the main obstruction to full adoption. Finally, for the practitioner, case examples and suggestions are provided to address the design, implementation and adoption issues. © 2014 IEEE.",Blended learning; holistic flipped classroom; transactional distance,Curricula; Design; Students; Blended learning; Classroom environment; Design and evaluations; Effective learning; holistic flipped classroom; Pedagogical method; Transactional distance; University teachers; Teaching,"Ash, K., Educators view 'flipped' mode with a more critical eye (2012) Education Week, , Aug. 29; Bergmann, J., Sams, A., Flip your classroom: Reach every student in every class every day (2012) Internal Society for Technology in Education, pp. 7-17; Bonwell, C.C., Eison, J.A., Active Learning: Creating excitement in the classroom (1991) Higher Education Reports; Caulfield, J., (2011) How to Design and Teach A Hybrid Course, pp. 19-26. , Stylus Publishing; Chen, N.-S., Ko, H.-C., Kinshuk, Lin, T., A model for synchronous learning using the Internet (2005) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 42 (2), pp. 181-194. , May; Chen, N.-S., Wang, Y., Testing principles of language learning in a cyber face-to-face environment (2008) Educational Technology & Society, 11 (3), pp. 97-113; Chen, N.-S., Tsai, C.-C., Knowledge infrastructure of the future (2009) Educational Technology & Society, 12 (1), pp. 1-4; Chen, N.-S., Ko, L., An online synchronous test for professional interpreters (2010) Educational Technology & Society, 13 (2), pp. 153-165; Hamdan, N., McKnigh, P., McKnight, K., Arfstrom, K., The flipped learning model: A white paper based on the leterature review (2013) Flipped Learning Network; Hamdan, N., McKnight, P., McKnight, K., Arfstrom, K., A review of flipped learning, george mason university, pearson's center for educator effectiveness (2013) Flipped Learning Network; Hastie, M., Chen, N.-S., Kuo, Y.-H., Instructional designfor best practice in the synchronous cyber classroom (2007) Educational Technology & Society, 10 (4), pp. 281-294; Hastie, M., Hung, I.-C., Chen, N.-S., Kinshuk, A blended synchronous learning model for educational international collaborations (2010) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 47 (1), pp. 9-24. , February; Kaleta, R., Garnham, C., Hybrid I: UW system hybrid course project-overview, faculty development, student resources (2001) Proceedings of the 17th Annual Conference on Distance Teaching and Learning, , University of Wisconsin-Madison; Moore, M.G., Kearsley, G., (1996) Research on Effectiveness, Distance Education: A Systems Review, , Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Pintrich, P., Schunk, D., (1996) Motivation in education: Theory, research and applications, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Staker, H., Horn, M., (2012) Classifying K-12 Blended Learning, , Innosight Institute; Teng, E.D.-C., Chen, N.-S., Kinshuk, L.T., Exploring students' learning experience in an international online research seminar in the Synchronous Cyber Classroom (2012) Computers & Education, 58, pp. 918-930; Tucker, B., The flipped classroom (2012) Education Next, (WINTER); Wang, Y., Chen, N.-S., Levy, M., Teacher training in a synchronous cyber face-to-face classroom: Characterizing and supporting the online teachers' learning process (2010) Computer Assisted Language Learning, 23 (4), pp. 277-293. , October; Wang, Y., Chen, N.-S., Levy, M., The design and implementation of a holistic training model for language teacher education in a cyber face-to-face learning environment (2010) Computers and Education, 55 (2), pp. 777-788; Wang, Y., Chen, N.-S., The collaborative language learning attributes of cyber face-to-face interaction: The perspectives of the learner (2012) Interactive Learning Environments, 20 (4), pp. 311-330",,9781479940387,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910058637

In the field of pre-service teacher education, a rising challenge is to equip the ""21st century teacher"" with the necessary toolset of skills and competencies to grapple with the idiosyncrasies of the new generation of ""millenials"". To this purpose, what still remains an open issue is the degree of innovation afforded by specific e-learning designs, in a field where traditional teacher training pedagogies co-exist with e-learning-specific ones. This article proposes a synthesis of two models, the Community of Inquiry (COI) model, based on the Practical Inquiry model introduced by Garrison, Anderson, & Archer (2000) and the Learning by Design framework (LbyD), based on the conceptualization of 'New Learning', articulated by Kalantzis & Cope (2012). Both models were invented with new learning styles and circumstances in mind. The proposed synthesis guided the design of the six-month introductory course in Technology Enhanced Learning by the School of Pedagogical and Technological Education (ASPETE) research team (located in Athens) and implemented with 18 pre service student-teachers at the Higher Education Technological Institute (TEI) of Lamia, located in another geographical area of Greece. In this context, elements of the COI framework were employed as tools both for designing and for evaluating the contents, structure and activities of the e-learning course. Two elements of the framework, teaching and cognitive presence were the axes supporting the course structure, whilst the kinds of activities most promoted were discussion, collaboration and reflection. The LbyD framework functioned as an awareness enhancement mechanism for trainee teachers to formulate, collaboratively negotiate and finally articulate and support pedagogical scenarios integrating the meaningful use of technology. The discussion of this experience is supported by a dataset including students' answers to a COI-based survey, free-text student feedback and asynchronous discussion transcripts, providing evidence about the potential of the approach and pointing out issues that need to be improved. © ACPIL.",Blended learning; Community of inquiry; Course design; Learning design; Online teacher training,,"Abbit, J., Ophus, J., What we know about the Impacts of Web-Quests: A review of research (2008) AACE Journal, 16 (4), pp. 441-456; Anderson, T., Rourke, L., Garrison, D.R., Archer, W., Assessing teaching presence in a computer conference context (2001) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 5. , http://www.sloanc.org/publications/jaln/v5n2/pdf/v5n2_anderson.pdf, available at: last access: 13/5/2013; Barnett, M., Issues and trends concerning electronic networking technologies for teacher professional development: A critical review of the literature (2002), paper presented at the annual meeting of American Educational Research Association, New Orleans; Bates, A., Computer-assisted learning or communications: Which way for information technology in distance education?

More institutional-level blended learning research is needed to guide institutions of higher education in strategically adopting and implementing blended learning on campus. This research investigates six cases of institutional adoption of blended learning to examine the key issues that can guide university administrators interested in this endeavor. Cases were selected to represent institutions at various stages of blended learning adoption including (1) awareness/exploration, (2) adoption/early implementation, and (3) mature implementation/growth. Cases are used to identify and elaborate on core issues related to institutional strategy, structure, and support, spanning the adoption stages. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Blended learning; Higher education policy; Hybrid courses; Institutional adoption,Societies and institutions; Blended learning; Higher education; Hybrid course; Institutional adoption; Institutional policies; Institutional strategy; Institutions of higher educations; Learning outcome; Education,"Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Garrett, R., Blending in: The extent and promise of blended education in the United States (2007), http://sloanconsortium.org/sites/default/files/Blending_In.pdf, Retrieved from; Al-Sarrani, N., (2010), http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/2097/3887/1/NauafAl-Sarrani2010.pdf, Concerns and professional development needs of science faculty at Taibah University in adopting blended learning (Doctoral Dissertation).

Continuous evaluation can effectively track the impact of blended learning on students, faculty, and the institution. These data are used to inform stakeholders and impact policy to improve faculty development and other support structures necessary for success. This iterative loop of continuous quality improvement is augmented by faculty scholarship of teaching and learning research.

MAgAdI is an adaptive web environment devoted to supporting the learning processes in overall contexts, in which several knowledge fields, courses and teachers are involved. So far, a three-year cyclical evaluation-improvement process has been developed on several subjects and participants (n = 80) of a Computer Science degree programme. This process embraced formative and summative evaluation phases with the aim of: discovering the implications of the blended-learning loop on the satisfaction of teachers and motivation of students confirming improvements in student learning; and testing the usability of the Student Workspace. Experimental data were collected by means of a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Results of this study detect improvements in the students' acquisition of knowledge in the three phases where it was evaluated (Wilcoxon-test, p = 0.02, p = 0.048, p = 0.044), which may be attributable to the use of MAgAdI. In addition, increments in student's motivation and teacher's satisfaction were also perceived. Thus, these results agree with previous findings of related works. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating face-to-face and online learning, blending can enhance learning and optimize seat time. This paper describes the use of the blended e-learning model in a course ""Data Structures and Algorithms"" given at the Afyon Kocatepe University, Turkey. This model is realized as a combination of a face-to-face environment and online learning, using the University's Learning Management System (LMS) named @KU-UZEM. The LMS consists of many applications in accordance with SCORM standards, such as, student records, user roles, courses, exams security applications, student affairs, counseling services, internal communication, director processes and evaluation. It provides whole software infrastructure by a virtual academic institution and is currently used in Afyon Kocatepe University. This paper describes both the technology for course design and programme redesign adopted a blended learning approach with both face-to-face and online learning aimed at enhancing the students' control over their own learning. According to the obtained results with the performed experimental evaluation, the realized blended learning model provided more effective and efficient educational experience rather than traditional, face-to-face learning. A survey conducted at the end of the course also showed that students were satisfied with the pedagogical approach, and their academic achievements were also better than expected. Particularly important is that the dropout rate was greatly diminished, which could be related to students' satisfaction with the support they received from the teacher and the system. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",blended learning; e-learning; educational technology; learning management system (LMS); web-based education system,Blended learning; Educational experiences; Experimental evaluation; Internal communications; Learning management system; Software infrastructure; Students' satisfaction; Web-based education systems; Blending; Computer programming; Curricula; Data structures; Education computing; Educational technology; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; E-learning,"McCormack, C., Jones, D., (1997) Building A Web-based Education System, , Wiley, New York; Hoic-Bozic, N., Vornar, V., Boticki, I., A blended learning approach to course design and implementation (2009) IEEE Trans Educ, 52, pp. 19-30; Greenberg, G., Distance education technologies: Best practices for K-12 settings (1998) IEEE Technol Soc Mag, 17, pp. 36-40; Passerini, K., Granger, M.J., A developmental model for distance learning using the Internet (2000) Comput Educ, 34, pp. 1-15; Keegan, D., (2004) Foundations of Distance Education, , Routledge, New York; Kaya, Z., (2002) Distance Education, , PegemA, Ankara; Akkoyunlu, B., Soylu, M., A study on students' views on blended learning environment (2006) Turk Online J Dist Educ, 7, pp. 43-56; Clark, R.T., Mayer, R.E., (2003) E-learning and the Science of Instruction, , Pfeiffer, San Francisco; (2007) Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: The E-Learning Action Plan, , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2001/com2001_0172en01.pdf, European Commission, (Mar. 2001), Nov; Berge, Z.L., Yi-Ping, H., (2004) A Model for Sustainable Student Retention: A Holistic Perspective on the Student Dropout Problem with Special Attention to E-learning, , http://www.ed.psu.edu/acsde/deos/deosnews/deosnews13_5.pdf, DEOSNEWS, 13, no. 5, May; Developing on-line collaboration (2000) Web-based Learning and Teaching Technologies - Opportunities and Challenges, pp. 226-244. , E.

We present the outcomes of an experimental study carried out during the academic years 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 with engineering students at the University of Salamanca (Spain). In the present research, as we have done in previous ones, we have selected a subject which is common to the four degrees under consideration: Computer Science. This study explores in greater depth the validity of experimental designs coming from educational research and the impact of innovative teaching methodologies. The hypothesis that impulses this research is formulated to ascertain that the learning level and the satisfaction of students will be higher after the implementation of new teaching methodologies (based on constructive learning, collaborative work, and blended learning resources), than in more traditional teaching contexts. The obtained results partially confirm this hypothesis. The ultimate purpose of this work is that of providing evidence that contributes to the improvement of education and teaching methods for a better performance of students in engineering. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The InfoCenter consists of elements of face-to-face teaching, of multimedia mediation (text books, slides, classic texts, interactive videos, FAQ lists, video glossaries), of Web 2.0 tools (wikis, weblogs, social networks, social bookmarking and folksonomies) and of the use of a learning management system (with learning units and tests). The platform was evaluated by its users (university students) by means of SERVQUAL. According to the evaluation, students are satisfied with the InfoCenter and are willing to use it for their exam preparation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Blended Learning; Didactic Theories; E-Learning; Higher Education; Web 2.0,Blended learning; Cognitivism; Didactic Theories; Folksonomies; Germany; Higher education; Interactive video; Learning management system; Learning platform; SERVQUAL; Social bookmarking; Social Networks; University students; Web 2.0; Weblogs; E-learning; Information technology; Social networking (online); Teaching; Telecommunication equipment; User interfaces; World Wide Web; Students,"Akbulut, Y., Kiyici, M., Instructional Use of Weblogs (2007) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 8 (3), pp. 6-15; Akkoyunlu, B., Yilmaz-Soylu, M., Development of a Scale on Learners' Views on Blended Learning and its Implementation Process (2008) Internet and Higher Education, 11, pp. 26-32; Alonso, F., López, G., Manrique, D., Viñes, J.M., An Instructional Model for Web-based E-learning Education with a Blended Learning Process Approach (2005) British Journal of Educational Technology, 36 (2), pp. 217-235; Arnold, P., Kilian, L., Thillosen, A., Zimmer, G., (2004) E-Learning.

The study was guided by the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, The Internet and Higher Education 2000; 2(2-3): 87-105). The focus was on a graduate level education course, the topic of which was blended learning. The course was given by the same instructor in a 13-week fall semester and a 6-week spring term. Transcript analysis of weekly online discussions and the CoI Survey were used to explore the differences between the short-term and long-term versions of this course in terms of each measure of CoI presence (social, teaching and cognitive presence). The findings showed differences between the short-term and long-term versions of this course in terms of the development of each presence and students' perceptions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",Community of inquiry; Online learning; Presence; Time effect,,"Akyol, Z., Garrison, D.R., The development of a community of inquiry over time in an online course: Understanding the progression and integration of social, cognitive and teaching presence (2008) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 12 (3-4), pp. 3-22; Anderson, T., Rourke, L., Garrison, D.R., Archer, W., Assessing teaching presence in computer conferencing context (2001) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 5 (2), pp. 1-17; Arbaugh, J.B., Does the community of inquiry framework predict outcomes in online MBA courses?

The participants in our study were students enrolled in a foreign policy course at a major Australian university. Students' conceptions of learning through discussion, and their approaches to both face-to-face and online discussion, were elicited through open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Students' responses to both open-ended questionnaires and interviews were analysed using a phenomenographic framework. Qualitative variations in students' conceptions and approaches were categorised and were found to form a hierarchy. Subsequent quantitative analysis found associations between students' conceptions of learning through discussion, their approaches to both face-to-face and online discussion and their academic performance (as indicated by the final mark for the course).

Institutional, national and global pressures demand that universities address issues of quality in teaching and learning. Universities are challenged to adapt their role to a new reality where two of the main concepts in this context are lifelong learning and mobility, which underlie the commitment of several European HE institutions following the Bologna Process. The purpose of this article is to examine the evaluation practices of teaching and learning in Portuguese Higher Education blended learning modules. Questions like who evaluates, how to evaluate, what is evaluated and what evaluation is for and also what should be implemented in order to improve course quality were put to the directors of the courses under scrutiny. The study was conducted with 18 of a total of 19 bLearning course directors in 11 Portuguese HE institutions. Results revealed that students, teachers and directors are the main performers of modules evaluation, although external agents are also seen as very relevant for this purpose in the near future. The main instruments used for evaluation are reports about the course and questionnaires to students. As to the objects of evaluation that are being selected in Portuguese institutions all directors mentioned the communication tools used, the quality of didactic materials and the pertinence of the learning tasks proposed, all of them also seen as most pertinent for the purposes of evaluation. The main goals of evaluation are the improvement of the curricular plans and the adequacy of the teaching strategies. Some recommendations of new methodologies for evaluation are put forward with the aim of improving HE teaching quality. © 2010 IADIS.",Blended learning; Evaluation; Higher Education,Blended learning; Bologna process; Communication tools; Didactic materials; Evaluation; External agents; Higher Education; Learning tasks; Life long learning; Portugal; Teaching and learning; Teaching quality; Teaching strategy; Computer science; E-learning; Engineering education; Information systems; Rating; Societies and institutions; Students; Surveys; Teaching,"Bliuc, A.-M., Goodyear, P., Ellis, R.A., Research focus and methodological choices in studies into students' experiences of blended learning in higher education (2007) Internet and Higher Education, 10 (4), pp. 231-244. , DOI 10.1016/j.iheduc.2007.08.001, PII S1096751607000516; Carneiro, R., (2003) A Evolução Do E-Learning em Portugal, , INOFOR, Lisbon, Portugal; Conole, G., Designing for learning (2007) Contemporary Perspectives in E-learning Research - Themes, Methods and Impact on Practice, pp. 101-120. , Conole, G. and Oliver M.
