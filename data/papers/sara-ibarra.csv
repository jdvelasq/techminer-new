In this context, novel educational concepts such as blended learning are being developed. In the present paper, we present the results obtained from a blended learning experience carried out at the University of Granada. A total of 17 groups took part, with 1431 students registered for the 2009-2010 academic year. In this study, we use objective outcomes and the students' perceptions regarding the blended learning activities performed. The study shows that the use of blended learning has a positive effect in reducing dropout rates and in improving exam marks. Moreover, the students' perceptions on blended learning are interrelated, with their final marks depending on the blended learning activities, and on the students' age, background and class attendance rate. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

More institutional-level blended learning research is needed to guide institutions of higher education in strategically adopting and implementing blended learning on campus. This research investigates six cases of institutional adoption of blended learning to examine the key issues that can guide university administrators interested in this endeavor. Cases were selected to represent institutions at various stages of blended learning adoption including (1) awareness/exploration, (2) adoption/early implementation, and (3) mature implementation/growth. Cases are used to identify and elaborate on core issues related to institutional strategy, structure, and support, spanning the adoption stages. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Blended learning; Higher education policy; Hybrid courses; Institutional adoption","Societies and institutions; Blended learning; Higher education; Hybrid course; Institutional adoption; Institutional policies; Institutional strategy; Institutions of higher educations; Learning outcome; Education","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Garrett, R., Blending in: The extent and promise of blended education in the United States (2007), http://sloanconsortium.org/sites/default/files/Blending_In.pdf, Retrieved from; Al-Sarrani, N., (2010), http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/2097/3887/1/NauafAl-Sarrani2010.pdf, Concerns and professional development needs of science faculty at Taibah University in adopting blended learning (Doctoral Dissertation).

Additional research is needed to guide institutions of higher education in strategically adopting and implementing blended learning on campus. The authors conducted a prior study in which they proposed a framework for institutional BL adoption (Graham, Woodfield, & Harrison, 2012), identifying three stages: (1) awareness/exploration, (2) adoption/early implementation, and (3) mature implementation/growth. The framework also identified key strategy, structure, and support issues universities may address at each stage. The current study applies this adoption framework to 11 U. S. institutions participating in a Next Generation Learning Challenge (NGLC) grant and attempting to transition from an awareness/ exploration of BL to the adoption/early implementation phase. The study also compares U.S. institutional strategy, structure, and support approaches to BL adoption and identifies patterns and distinctions. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Distance education and telelearning; Post-secondary education; Teaching/learning strategies","Adoption framework; Blended learning; Distance education and tele-learning; Higher education; Institutional strategy; Institutions of higher educations; Postsecondary education; Teaching/learning strategy; Distance education; Societies and institutions","Al-Sarrani, N., (2010) Concerns and Professional Development Needs of Science Faculty at Taibah University in Adopting Blended Learning, , (Doctoral dissertation).

However, expensive equipment and limited time prevent teachers having sufficient educational platforms, and several low cost and flexible solutions have been developed to permit an effective teaching in Automatics and Robotics at a reasonable cost. Virtual and remote laboratories are inside this group of solutions as Web-based experimentation tools which have demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of hand-on experiences. This paper presents an experience teaching based on a blended-learning method using as experimentation tool a virtual and remote robotic laboratory called RobUALab, which is also described in the paper, in Automatics and Robotics subjects of the Computer Science degree at the University of Alicante. Students experiment with a set of hand-on exercises about Automatics and Robotics using RobUALab, firstly in face-to-face classes where they experiment in-situ with the real plant and, afterwards, they access to the experimentation environment in order to finish remotely their practical exercises outside the laboratory. The results obtained in the evaluation of the educational methodology proposed attest its efficiency in terms of learning degree and performance of the students. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

They are reflections of the progressive change in higher education over the last few decades towards more student-and learning centred pedagogies and practices, which are made possible through new technologies and more delivery of online and blended (combination of face-to-face and online components) courses. The increasing personalising and flexibility of learning in higher education requires equal attention spent to assessment practices to ensure a cohesive learning experience. This paper provides the findings and conclusions of a study about a flipped classroom, which also included flexible assessment components. The study showed that students enjoy and are more engaged in a flipped classroom, prefer a blended learning to a fully online learning approach, want and require clear structure and guidelines, and strongly value flexible assessment through more choices and control. The main concern of higher education teachers is the time commitment and lack of institutional support for flipping classrooms and providing flexible assessment. It is argued that personalising learning requires more personalising of assessment, and that it is mainly the responsibility of teachers and institutions to develop 'flexible students'. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Flexible assessment; Flexible learning; Flipped classroom; Higher education; Personalised learning","E-learning; Education; Social networking (online); Students; Flexible assessments; Flexible Learning; Flipped classroom; Higher education; Personalised learning; Teaching","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2013) Changing Course: Ten Years of Tracking Online Education in the United States, , http://sloanconsortium.org/publications/survey/changing_course_2012, Accessed 12.02.14; Biggs, J., (2003) Teaching for Quality Learning at University, , 2nd ed.

The framework also identified key strategy, structure, and support issues universities may address at each stage. In this paper, the authors applied that framework as well as Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovations theory to determine the degree to which institutional strategy, structure, and support measures facilitate or impede BL adoption among higher education faculty. In addition, the authors explored whether higher education faculty's innovation adoption category affects which measures facilitate or impede BL adoption. To achieve these objectives, the authors surveyed 214 faculty and interviewed 39 faculty at a school in the adoption/early implementation stage of BL adoption. The authors published the survey results in a prior article. The current article explores the results of the interviews. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Blended learning; Faculty adoption; Higher education policy; Hybrid learning; Institutional adoption","Driver training; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Blended learning; Faculty adoption; Higher education; Hybrid learning; Institutional adoption; Education","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Online nation: Five years of growth in online learning (2007) Sloan Consortium Report; Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Garrett, R., Blending in: The extent and promise of blended education in the United States (2007) Proceedings of the Sloan Consortium, , http://sloanconsortium.org/sites/default/files/Blending_In.pdf; Beggs, T.A., Influences and barriers to the adoption of instructional technology (2000) Paper Presented at Mid-South Instructional Technology Conference, , April Mid-South Instructional Technology Conference Murfreesboro, TN; Christo-Baker, E., Distance education leadership in higher education institutions: Explored within theoretical frameworks of organizational change and diffusion of innovations theory (2004) Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications 2004, pp. 251-256. , http://www.editlib.org/p/12940, L.

The focus was on a graduate level education course, the topic of which was blended learning. The course was given by the same instructor in a 13-week fall semester and a 6-week spring term. Transcript analysis of weekly online discussions and the CoI Survey were used to explore the differences between the short-term and long-term versions of this course in terms of each measure of CoI presence (social, teaching and cognitive presence). The findings showed differences between the short-term and long-term versions of this course in terms of the development of each presence and students' perceptions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Community of inquiry; Online learning; Presence; Time effect",,"Akyol, Z., Garrison, D.R., The development of a community of inquiry over time in an online course: Understanding the progression and integration of social, cognitive and teaching presence (2008) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 12 (3-4), pp. 3-22; Anderson, T., Rourke, L., Garrison, D.R., Archer, W., Assessing teaching presence in computer conferencing context (2001) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 5 (2), pp. 1-17; Arbaugh, J.B., Does the community of inquiry framework predict outcomes in online MBA courses?

This paper presents a case study that proposes a computer-assisted collaborative experience designed to help students in their transition from high school to university. This is done by facilitating their first contact with the campus and its services, the university community, methodologies and activities. The experience combines individual and collaborative activities, conducted in and out of the classroom, structured following the Jigsaw Collaborative Learning Flow Pattern. A specific environment including portable technologies with network and computer applications has been developed to support and facilitate the orchestration of a flow of learning activities into a single integrated learning setting. The result is a Computer Supported Collaborative Blended Learning scenario that has been evaluated with first-year university students of the degrees of Software and Audiovisual Engineering within the subject Introduction to Information and Communications Technologies. The findings reveal that the scenario improves significantly students' interest in their studies and their understanding about the campus and services provided. The environment is also an innovative approach to successfully support the heterogeneous activities conducted by both teachers and students during the scenario. This paper introduces the goals and context of the case study, describes how the technology was employed to conduct the learning scenario, the evaluation methods and the main results of the experience. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The participants in our study were students enrolled in a foreign policy course at a major Australian university. Students' conceptions of learning through discussion, and their approaches to both face-to-face and online discussion, were elicited through open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Students' responses to both open-ended questionnaires and interviews were analysed using a phenomenographic framework. Qualitative variations in students' conceptions and approaches were categorised and were found to form a hierarchy. Subsequent quantitative analysis found associations between students' conceptions of learning through discussion, their approaches to both face-to-face and online discussion and their academic performance (as indicated by the final mark for the course).

We present the outcomes of an experimental study carried out during the academic years 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 with engineering students at the University of Salamanca (Spain). In the present research, as we have done in previous ones, we have selected a subject which is common to the four degrees under consideration: Computer Science. This study explores in greater depth the validity of experimental designs coming from educational research and the impact of innovative teaching methodologies. The hypothesis that impulses this research is formulated to ascertain that the learning level and the satisfaction of students will be higher after the implementation of new teaching methodologies (based on constructive learning, collaborative work, and blended learning resources), than in more traditional teaching contexts. The obtained results partially confirm this hypothesis. The ultimate purpose of this work is that of providing evidence that contributes to the improvement of education and teaching methods for a better performance of students in engineering. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Apdo. 649, E-20080, Spain","This paper reports the experiment carried out at the University of the Basque Country concerning the integration of the MAgAdI on-line system within traditional teaching/learning methods. MAgAdI is an adaptive web environment devoted to supporting the learning processes in overall contexts, in which several knowledge fields, courses and teachers are involved. So far, a three-year cyclical evaluation-improvement process has been developed on several subjects and participants (n = 80) of a Computer Science degree programme. This process embraced formative and summative evaluation phases with the aim of: discovering the implications of the blended-learning loop on the satisfaction of teachers and motivation of students confirming improvements in student learning; and testing the usability of the Student Workspace. Experimental data were collected by means of a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Results of this study detect improvements in the students' acquisition of knowledge in the three phases where it was evaluated (Wilcoxon-test, p = 0.02, p = 0.048, p = 0.044), which may be attributable to the use of MAgAdI. In addition, increments in student's motivation and teacher's satisfaction were also perceived. Thus, these results agree with previous findings of related works. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We used intensive longitudinal methodology to collect activity level engagement data throughout a semester for 68 students enrolled in six blended courses across two universities. We used structural equation modeling to gain a holistic understanding of learning environments, including the influence of personal characteristics, course design, and student perceptions of the learning experience on in-the-moment cognitive and emotional engagement. To investigate longitudinal relationships between emotional and cognitive engagement, we employed cross-lagged modeling techniques. Findings showed that course design and student perception variables had a greater influence on engagement than individual student characteristics and that student multitasking had a strong negative influence on engagement. Students' perceptions of the importance of the activity had a strong positive influence on both cognitive and emotional engagement. An important outcome of engagement was the students' perceptions that they were learning and improving. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Blended learning; Cognitive engagement; Emotional engagement; Higher education; Intensive longitudinal methods; Structural equation modeling","Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Students; Blended learning; Cognitive engagement; Emotional engagements; Higher education; Longitudinal methods; Structural equation modeling; Education","Ainley, M., Students' interest and engagement in classroom activities (2012) Handbook of research on student engagement, pp. 283-302. , S.L.

In this study, university students in first year engineering were required to collaborate and inquire in a blended course design over a semester-long course. This study investigates their approaches to inquiry and online learning technologies as they collaborated both in class and online. The results identify sub-groups within the population sample (n > 200) which reported qualitatively different experiences of how they approached inquiry and used the online learning technologies. The results also measure aspects of their collaborations which help to explain why some students were more successful than others.

Increasingly, emphasis is being placed on the design of new learning spaces, often referred to as ""Next Generation Learning Spaces"" (NGLS) and their impact on pedagogy. The traditional idea of ""classroom"" now incorporates the use of both physical and virtual space. Increasing availability of digital technologies has enabled access by teachers and students to a wider range of communication and information that can now be incorporated into the formal learning process. This change has meant a greater focus on the design and use of flexible learning spaces, more use of blended learning approaches and more personalised, individualised learning opportunities for students. While many such classrooms have been built and used in universities globally, only a few formal studies have been reported on how these spaces are used by both teachers and students. This article focuses on a pilot study of the use by academic staff and students of a next generation learning space - the Pod Room - and makes recommendations for further research into the effectiveness of new learning spaces in universities. © 2012 G.

Mining of LMS users' data, involving artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic, is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer) consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends, considering one academic year of the LMS use from 75 professors and 1037 students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal dependencies representation of Moodle LMS users' QoI, revealing perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level. Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and analysis of the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of the LMS use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors and decision-makers of HEIs could be assisted to holistically visualize, understand and assess OLEs stakeholders' needs within the teaching and learning practices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Integrating face-to-face and online learning, blending can enhance learning and optimize seat time. This paper describes the use of the blended e-learning model in a course ""Data Structures and Algorithms"" given at the Afyon Kocatepe University, Turkey. This model is realized as a combination of a face-to-face environment and online learning, using the University's Learning Management System (LMS) named @KU-UZEM. The LMS consists of many applications in accordance with SCORM standards, such as, student records, user roles, courses, exams security applications, student affairs, counseling services, internal communication, director processes and evaluation. It provides whole software infrastructure by a virtual academic institution and is currently used in Afyon Kocatepe University. This paper describes both the technology for course design and programme redesign adopted a blended learning approach with both face-to-face and online learning aimed at enhancing the students' control over their own learning. According to the obtained results with the performed experimental evaluation, the realized blended learning model provided more effective and efficient educational experience rather than traditional, face-to-face learning. A survey conducted at the end of the course also showed that students were satisfied with the pedagogical approach, and their academic achievements were also better than expected. Particularly important is that the dropout rate was greatly diminished, which could be related to students' satisfaction with the support they received from the teacher and the system. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","blended learning; e-learning; educational technology; learning management system (LMS); web-based education system","Blended learning; Educational experiences; Experimental evaluation; Internal communications; Learning management system; Software infrastructure; Students' satisfaction; Web-based education systems; Blending; Computer programming; Curricula; Data structures; Education computing; Educational technology; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; E-learning","McCormack, C., Jones, D., (1997) Building A Web-based Education System, , Wiley, New York; Hoic-Bozic, N., Vornar, V., Boticki, I., A blended learning approach to course design and implementation (2009) IEEE Trans Educ, 52, pp. 19-30; Greenberg, G., Distance education technologies: Best practices for K-12 settings (1998) IEEE Technol Soc Mag, 17, pp. 36-40; Passerini, K., Granger, M.J., A developmental model for distance learning using the Internet (2000) Comput Educ, 34, pp. 1-15; Keegan, D., (2004) Foundations of Distance Education, , Routledge, New York; Kaya, Z., (2002) Distance Education, , PegemA, Ankara; Akkoyunlu, B., Soylu, M., A study on students' views on blended learning environment (2006) Turk Online J Dist Educ, 7, pp. 43-56; Clark, R.T., Mayer, R.E., (2003) E-learning and the Science of Instruction, , Pfeiffer, San Francisco; (2007) Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: The E-Learning Action Plan, , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2001/com2001_0172en01.pdf, European Commission, (Mar. 2001), Nov; Berge, Z.L., Yi-Ping, H., (2004) A Model for Sustainable Student Retention: A Holistic Perspective on the Student Dropout Problem with Special Attention to E-learning, , http://www.ed.psu.edu/acsde/deos/deosnews/deosnews13_5.pdf, DEOSNEWS, 13, no. 5, May; Developing on-line collaboration (2000) Web-based Learning and Teaching Technologies - Opportunities and Challenges, pp. 226-244. , E.

Furthermore, the social capital framework has scarcely been used to explain online participation in educational settings, despite its prevalence in virtual contexts. The present study aims to uncover the unique predictive value of altruism, perceived learning benefits as a measure of performance expectancy, and social capital with regard to adult learners' online participation in addition to socio-demographic variables. A questionnaire was administered and completed by 181 adult learners following a blended learning program in Flanders (Belgium). Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that working learners, lower degree holders, and females are the keenest participants in online participation. We also found that performance expectancy outweighed altruism in explaining online participation. Only two dimensions of social capital, namely sense of belonging and norms of reciprocity, significantly predicted online participation. Based on these findings, pedagogical and research implications are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although this learning mode is not new in higher education, little research has been done to contextualise social presence experiences in which effects of interactions were explored for enhancing learning. A qualitative approach was adopted using the case study method to examine the instructor and students’ pedagogic interactions in the social presence of a blended synchronous learning environment. This paper reports an exploration of the blended learning with an online group of students at a remote site attending a computer-aided engineering drawing course synchronously with a face-to-face group taught by an instructor in a laboratory. The process of interaction was visually and verbally mediated by videoconference as if in an online face-to-face learning community. The findings show that the online and face-to-face groups had different social presence experiences in which interaction emerged. Emotional adaptation and practice is needed for the students and the instructor in such a complex environment. Based on the interaction patterns, a framework of interactions in the blended synchronous learning environment is conceptualised to inform course development and instructional design. Implications for further study are also discussed. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","blended synchronous learning; face-to-face teaching; interactions; online learning; social presence; virtual environment",,"Akyol, Z., Arbaugh, J.B., Cleveland-Innes, M., Garrison, D.R., Ice, P., Richardson, J.C., Swan, K., A response to the review of the community of inquiry framework (2009) Journal of Distance Education, 23 (2), pp. 123-136; Akyol, Z., Garrison, D.R., Understanding cognitive presence in an online and blended community of inquiry: Assessing outcomes and processes for deep approaches to learning (2011) British Journal of Educational Technology, 42 (2), pp. 233-250; Bassey, M., On the nature of research in education (part 2) (1990) Research Intelligence, 37 (Summer), pp. 39-44; Bianco, M.B., Carr-Chellman, A.A., Exploring qualitative methodologies in online learning environments (2007) Online learning community, pp. 299-317. , Luppicini R., (ed), Charlotte, NC: IAP; Bonk, C.J., Graham, C.R., (2006) The handbook of blended learning: Global perspectives, local designs, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Chen, N.-S., Ko, H.-C., Kinshuk, Lin, T., A model for synchronous learning using the Internet (2005) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 42 (2), pp. 181-194; Cobb, S.C., Social presence and online learning: A current view from a research perspective (2009) Journal of Interactive Online Learning, 8 (3), pp. 241-254; Cohen, J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales (1960) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20 (1), pp. 37-46; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., (2003) E-learning in the 21st century, , London: RoutedgeFalmer; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., Archer, W., Critical inquiry in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education (2000) The Internet and Higher Education, 2 (2-3), pp. 87-105; Garrison, D.R., Cleveland-Innes, M., Facilitating cognitive presence in online learning: Interaction is not enough (2005) The American Journal of Distance Education, 19 (3), pp. 133-148; Garrison, D.R., Vaughan, N.D., (2008) Blended learning in higher education: Framework, principles, and guidelines, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Gregori, E., Torras, E., Guasch, T., Cognitive attainment in online learning environments: Matching cognitive and technological presence (2012) Interactive Learning Environments, 20 (5), pp. 467-483; Gunawardena, C.N., Social presence theory and implications for interaction and collaborative learning in computer conferences (1995) International Journal of Education Telecommunications, 1 (2-3), pp. 147-166; Gunawardena, C.N., Zittle, F.J., Social presence as a predictor of satisfaction with a computer-mediated conferencing environment (1997) American Journal of Distance Education, 11, pp. 8-26; Hastie, M., Hung, I.-C., Chen, N.-S., Kinshuk, A blended synchronous learning model for educational international collaboration (2010) Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 47 (1), pp. 9-24; Kreijns, K., Kirschner, P.A., Jochems, W., Identifying the pitfalls for social interaction in computer-supported collaborative learning environments: A review of the research (2003) Computers in Human Behavior, 19 (3), pp. 335-353; Kreijns, K., Kirschner, P.A., Jochems, W., Measuring perceived social presence in distributed learning groups (2011) Education Information Technology, 16 (4), pp. 365-381; Lawson, T., Comber, C., Gage, J., Cullum-Hanshaw, A., Images of the future for education?

However, the adoption of BL practices continues at a low pace due to academics' low digital fluency, various views and BL definitions, and limited standards-based tools to guide academic practice. To address these issues, this paper introduces a BL framework, based on one definition and with criteria and standards of practice to support the evaluation and advancement of BL in higher education. The framework is theoretically underpinned by the extant literature and supported by focus group discussions. The evidence supporting the criteria and standards are discussed with suggestions for how they can be used to guide course design, academic practice, and professional development. © 2015 N.

This paper reports on an investigation into the use of a blended learning approach to teaching and learning of programming in a class of more than 200 students. A course and learning environment was designed by integrating constructivist learning models of Constructive Alignment, Conversational Framework and the Three-Stage Learning Model. Design science research is used for the course redesign and development of the learning environment, and action research is integrated to undertake participatory evaluation of the intervention. The action research involved the Students' Approach to Learning survey, a comparative analysis of students' performance, and qualitative data analysis of data gathered from various sources. The paper makes a theoretical contribution in presenting a design of a blended learning solution for large class teaching of programming grounded in constructivist learning theory and use of free and open source technologies. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","blended learning; constructivist learning; large class teaching; programming",,"Apple, D.K., Nelson, D., Identification of non-success factors in a large introductory computer science course and constructive interventions for increasing student success (2002) 32nd Annual Frontiers in Education, 2002.

In the field of pre-service teacher education, a rising challenge is to equip the ""21st century teacher"" with the necessary toolset of skills and competencies to grapple with the idiosyncrasies of the new generation of ""millenials"". To this purpose, what still remains an open issue is the degree of innovation afforded by specific e-learning designs, in a field where traditional teacher training pedagogies co-exist with e-learning-specific ones. This article proposes a synthesis of two models, the Community of Inquiry (COI) model, based on the Practical Inquiry model introduced by Garrison, Anderson, & Archer (2000) and the Learning by Design framework (LbyD), based on the conceptualization of 'New Learning', articulated by Kalantzis & Cope (2012). Both models were invented with new learning styles and circumstances in mind. The proposed synthesis guided the design of the six-month introductory course in Technology Enhanced Learning by the School of Pedagogical and Technological Education (ASPETE) research team (located in Athens) and implemented with 18 pre service student-teachers at the Higher Education Technological Institute (TEI) of Lamia, located in another geographical area of Greece. In this context, elements of the COI framework were employed as tools both for designing and for evaluating the contents, structure and activities of the e-learning course. Two elements of the framework, teaching and cognitive presence were the axes supporting the course structure, whilst the kinds of activities most promoted were discussion, collaboration and reflection. The LbyD framework functioned as an awareness enhancement mechanism for trainee teachers to formulate, collaboratively negotiate and finally articulate and support pedagogical scenarios integrating the meaningful use of technology. The discussion of this experience is supported by a dataset including students' answers to a COI-based survey, free-text student feedback and asynchronous discussion transcripts, providing evidence about the potential of the approach and pointing out issues that need to be improved. © ACPIL.","Blended learning; Community of inquiry; Course design; Learning design; Online teacher training",,"Abbit, J., Ophus, J., What we know about the Impacts of Web-Quests: A review of research (2008) AACE Journal, 16 (4), pp. 441-456; Anderson, T., Rourke, L., Garrison, D.R., Archer, W., Assessing teaching presence in a computer conference context (2001) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 5. , http://www.sloanc.org/publications/jaln/v5n2/pdf/v5n2_anderson.pdf, available at: last access: 13/5/2013; Barnett, M., Issues and trends concerning electronic networking technologies for teacher professional development: A critical review of the literature (2002), paper presented at the annual meeting of American Educational Research Association, New Orleans; Bates, A., Computer-assisted learning or communications: Which way for information technology in distance education?

The principal results are that the average price students are willing to pay to download iLectures is approximately $30 per equivalent full time student. These results provide higher education institutions a benchmark of the economic benefits of iLectures in the view of students. The study concludes that these average prices are relevant for higher education institutions to match their own per capita start-up costs with the prices students are willing to download iLectures.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on data obtained from 138 undergraduate business management students at a university in Singapore, practical aspects of effectively implementing an e-learning system with a focus on KM are analyzed and the importance determined of three conceptual variables in the context of successful blended learning approaches: online faculty to student interaction, social presence and personal e-learning experiences. Findings: The study shows some positive correlations between online faculty to student interaction, the degree of presence in a web-based learning environment, as well as personal e-learning experiences as potential drivers of students' desire to learn more about the subject matter KM. Research limitations/implications: There has been reliance on self-reported data in both the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats study and the student survey. The causal effects of students' perceptions on actual learning need to be explored in a future study with a larger sample size. Practical implications: To increase students' acceptance of a web-based KM course, instructors must ensure quality interaction between them and their students, strong social presence via intrinsically rewarding group interactions and enriching, personal e-learning experiences on the basis of real-life KM problems. Games, systematic performance monitoring and graded knowledge tests are critical, too. Originality/value: This study highlights several good design features of an effective student interface vis-à-vis the development of an effective online learning environment from the perspective of KM student learners. Implications for e-learning designers and instructors, as well as issues for further research, are outlined. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","E-learning; Knowledge management; Virtual learning environments; Web site design",,"Alavi, M., Gallupe, R.B., Using information technology in learning: Case studies in business and management education programs (2003) Academy of Management Learning and Education, 2 (2), pp. 139-153; Alavi, M., Leidner, D.E., Review: Knowledge management and KM systems: Conceptual foundations and research issues (2001) MIS Quarterly, 25 (1), pp. 107-136; Albrecht, B., Enriching student experience through blended learning (2006) Educause Center for Applied Research Bulletin, (12); Arbaugh, J.B., Is there an optimal design for on-line MBA courses?

Design/methodology/approach – This paper employs a quantitative and qualitative approach where data were sourced from a third year finance unit across one semester using a survey instrument. SPSS v20 was used to perform basic descriptive analysis. Findings – The study revealed that by providing an online learning community through the use of Blackboard Collaborate! significantly enhances transactional engagement beyond the classroom. In particular the use of Blackboard Collaborate! allowed the teacher to be more accessible, supportive, expect and support high standards and provide challenging activities that generated rich and meaningful interactions and promoted higher order thinking skills. Research limitations/implications – The positive results emanating from this study may encourage other educators and their institutions to adopt a synchronous online learning community to enhance student’s engagement levels and increase the quality of student learning and their university experience. This study was conducted at only one university so it may not be feasible to form generalisations resulting from the findings. Originality/value – This study adds new insights towards the scarce amount of literature on engagement in a blended learning environment.

The authors explore the influence of teachers' perceptions of their competence in the use they make of digital material and to measure institutional support for teachers in this area. The methodology consists of an ad hoc questionnaire designed for a representative sample from four universities and the application of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results show that the use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) in universities in Andalusia is common but there is little sign of educational innovation, except in a minority of teachers. In addition, it was found that teachers' perceptions of their technological competence influenced their use of LMS but not the pedagogical model. The university pedagogical model must be reconceptualised, with a shift in traditional university values toward innovation, cooperation, and a shared construction of knowledge.

The contribution of student's characteristics and styles of learning to note taking activity and learning performance were analyzed, and the relationships between the two types of courses were compared using causal analysis techniques. In addition, lexical analysis of the contents of notes taken was introduced. Features of notes taken, such as the number of terms, the word ratios of student's notes and the degree of coverage of the lecturer's notes were compared. The results of the evaluation of the two types of learning styles were summarized by determining the relationships between student's characteristics and metrics of the contents of notes taken. The metrics were significantly different between the two learning styles. The contributions of students' characteristics to learning performance were also different. These results provide points to consider for the design and organization of the two types of learning.

These methods have been used in the Energy Thermal Master class that is offered in the Engineering School at the University of Vigo. The study presents an innovative learning method in which two new pedagogical concepts are combined, “learning by doing” and “blended learning,” implying a modernization of the classical learning methods. Using the methodology described below, students are able to operate a biomass experimental as well as use numerous measuring devices to obtain the combustion parameters, which are the latest commercial technology. Furthermore, by using LabVIEW programming, students are able to realize the importance of automation in the facilities and to create a code that is responsible for the control, supervision and monitoring of the system. In addition to the purely experimental aspect, students must analyze the data acquired by LabVIEW, apply their theoretical knowledge and exchange data with other groups, improving their teamwork skills. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our study assesses the response of one higher education institution (HEI) to the changing digital landscape and its transition into enhanced blended learning, which seeks to go beyond the early implementation stage to make the most effective use of online learning technologies to enhance the student experience and student learning outcomes. Evidence from a qualitative study comprising 20 semi-structured interviews, informed by a literature review, has resulted in the development of a holistic framework to guide HEIs transitioning into enhanced blended learning. The proposed framework addresses questions relating to the why (change agents), what (institutional considerations), how (organisational preparedness) and who (stakeholders) of transitions into enhanced blended learning. The involvement of all stakeholder groups is essential to a successful institutional transition into enhanced blended learning. © 2017, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

To conduct a quantitative comparison of the contents of all notes for effective instruction from lecturer to students to occur, the contents were mathematically compared and evaluated using two ways of summarizing the frequency of term co-occurrences. In order to evaluate visually the differences between the contents of notes taken, an adjacency matrix and Levenshtein distance metrics were employed to represent noun co-occurrence in the notes. In comparing notes between the lecturer and students, insufficient distance and additional distance are defined and measured for all participants during the course. In the results, students recorded additional nouns to replace the nouns given by the lecturer, and introduced new nouns of their own as substitutes as well. There are significant correlation relationships between the above mentioned distances and the ratios, such as between the word ratio and coverage, which have been defined in previous studies. Also, summarizing ways of co-occurrence frequency did not affect any of the relationships. Finally, possible applications for visualizing learning activities of the lecturer and students are discussed. © 2016, IGI Global.","Adjacency matrix; Blended learning; Distance; Note assessment; Term co-occurrence","Computer aided instruction; Education; Students; Teaching; Adjacency matrices; Blended learning; Distance; Note assessment; Term co-occurrence; Quality control","IGraph: Network analysis and visualization, , http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html, iGraph [online] Available; Jackson, P., Moulinier, I., (2002) Natural Language Processing for Online Applications -Text Retrieval, Extraction and Categorization, , Amsterdam, Netherlands: John Benjamins Publishing; Jin, M., (2009) Tekisuto Deta No Tokei Kagaku Nyumon, , Tokyo, Japan: Iwanami Shoten; Kiewra, K.A., Students' note-taking behaviors and the efficacy of providing the instructor's notes for review (1985) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 10 (4), pp. 378-386; Kiewra, K.A., A review of note-taking: The encoding-storage paradigm and beyond (1989) Educational Psychology Review, 1 (2), pp. 147-172; Kiewra, K.A., Benton, S.L., Kim, S.-I., Risch, N., Christensen, M., Effects of note-taking format and study technique on recall and relational performance (1995) Contemporary Educational Psychology, 20 (2), pp. 172-187; Kobayashi, K., What limits the encoding effect of note-taking?

It examines the effectiveness of the application of interactive and collaborative resources to improve reading and writing in English. Based on the overall evaluation of the blended course, most students believe that online glossary, online questionnaire, wiki and forum are good tools to improve their written skills. They are strongly aware of the necessity of improving these skills, and consider that the activities designed through these technological tools have allowed them to foster effective written communication in a variety of situations. Students also emphasize the potential of collaborative tools to communicate and develop collaborative learning. However, some students consider that there is a lack of privacy and fluency in communication, and believe that interactions are impersonal and disorganized, so they have had problems to do the activities and communicate suitably.","Adult Learning; Blended Learning; Collaborative Learning; Hypermedia Modular Model; Second Language; Written Skills",,"Arnal, J., Rinco, D., Latorre, A., (1994) Investigación Educativa.

One possible approach to explore the quality of online learning is to adopt the perspective of the decision-makers, the higher educational institutions and their staff. Another approach is to investigate what are the different dimensions of quality online learning experience from the perspective of students. This article presents a study of students' opinions and attitudes about the quality of different elements in the pedagogical design of blended courses. The majority of the students involved in the research have had no or little experience in online learning. The authors try to find out whether there is a relation between the students' previous experience in e-learning and their judgements about different aspects of its quality.

Background Online and blended learning modes continue to grow in popularity in higher education, with the aim of streamlining and enhancing student learning, supporting collaboration and creativity, and equipping students with the skills they will require to work and live in an increasingly digitized world. This practice-based case study highlights factors which positively and negatively affect user engagement with digital learning objects and ex-plores students' perceptions of the role of online learning within their aca-demic programs. Methodology A suite of nine interactive e-tutorials, addressing essential digital literacy skills for university students, was developed through instructor and student peer collaboration using Articulate software, informed by best practice. The e-tutorials were embedded in the institutional Learning Management System for three undergraduate and postgraduate courses, in which digital literacy formed the core learning content, to complement classroom-based learning. Students in these courses were surveyed via SurveyMonkey about their specific experience of using the e-tutorials, as well as their general perceptions of digital literacy and online learning. Eighty-six students in total completed the questionnaire, which consisted of twenty-three closed- and open-ended questions. Contribution Through highlighting both the positive and the challenging aspects of the students' reported experience of online learning, this case study contrib-utes useful insights to the body of literature on user engagement with digi-tal learning objects in higher education, as well as students' perceptions and experience of blended learning. Findings The e-tutorials were perceived as valuable in reinforcing classroom learn-ing, allowing respondents to revise concepts and materials covered in face-to-face classes, at their own pace and in their own time. Survey responses showed that the accessibility, ease-of-use, design and duration of the e-tutorials were deemed effective in terms of user engagement; however, several technological challenges were identified, such as browser incompat-ibility, uneven sound quality and general Internet connection issues, which disrupted their learning. Overall, students expressed enjoyment of the learning facilitated by the e-tutorials; however, rather than favoring online learning alone, they expressed a preference for a blended learning envi-ronment, with a combination of complementary learning approaches; sur-vey respondents did not generally wish to forego face-to-face classes en-tirely. Recommendations for Practitioners Instructors should seek to strategically embed interactive digital learning objects in their courses at defined points of need in a logical structure, e.g., to reinforce classroom-based learning, or to support specific skill develop-ment. Potential disruption to learning should be minimized by following best practice guidelines to ensure ease of access, a seamless user experi-ence, and timely feedback, as well as providing adequate support for rapid resolution of technical glitches. Recommendations for Researchers E-tutorials offer a useful means of exploring ways in which students ac-quire learning in the digital environment. A wider, collaborative exploration is needed to provide comparative studies which move beyond case studies. Impact on Society Online learning mechanisms, such as e-tutorials, offer students different means of acquiring essential literacy skills and different ways to interact with content. E-tutorials constitute reusable learning objects, which can be accessed as just-in-time delivery modes, when students perceive they need to review particular skills or reinforce learning material. Future Research This research is now expanding into different types of reusable learning objects. E-tutorials may be developed in multiple ways, and comparative research around e-tutorial models will deepen our understanding of how students interact with content in formal learning contexts. As the digital educational landscape continues to expand alongside traditional face-to-face and analogue learning modes, a key research focus will be student and instructor perceptions and experience of blended learning in different con-texts. © 2019, Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice.","Blended learning; Digital literacy; E-learning; E-tutorials; Higher education; Online learning; Online tutorials","Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Human computer interaction; Sound reproduction; Surveys; Blended learning; Digital literacies; Higher education; Online learning; Online tutorials; Students","Ademole-Odeshi, E., Attitudes of students towards e-learning in South-West Nigerian universities: An application of technology acceptance model (2014) Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal), 1035, pp. 1-18. , http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/1035; Ala-Mutka, K., Mapping digital competence: Towards a conceptual understanding (2011) JRC Technical Notes, JRC67075, , http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC67075_TN.pdf, Seville: Institute for Prospective Technological Studies; Barber, W., King, S., Teacher-student perspectives of invisible pedagogy: New directions in online problem-based learning environments (2016) The Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 14 (4), pp. 235-243. , www.ejel.org/issue/download.html?idArticle=509; Bawden, D., Information and digital literacies: A review of concepts (2001) Journal of Documentation, 57 (2), pp. 218-259. , https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007083; Bawden, D., Origins and concepts of digital literacy (2008) Digital litera-cies: Concepts, policies and practices, pp. 17-32. , http://pages.ucsd.edu/~bgoldfarb/comt109w10/reading/Lankshear-Knobel_et_al-DigitalLiteracies.pdf, In C.

The course was based on the principles of distance learning; it utilised the opensource learning management system - Moodle, and it was implemented as an action research project for three consecutive semesters (2014-2016). Its pedagogical aim was to investigate a prototype model of digital learning: the 'interactive evaluation' that was embodied in the design of the e-course and in the cycles of action research. Acting as creators, teachers and researchers in order to investigate the student-evaluators' perceptions of the e-course, we attempted to 'produce' wider knowledge of the assessment criteria within the context of blended education. In particular, the how and why specific learning criteria and critical approach to knowledge can be organised as more general constructivist and student-centred indexes of the learning technology. As a case study, the research outcomes revealed factors related to expression of interest, encouragement for participation and motivation of students to infiltrate, evaluate the e-course and contribute to remodelling its educational material.

During their studies, students are enroled in several e-courses. They perceive various aspects of e-courses and show different responses when using teaching materials and learning in an e-course. The purpose of this paper is to measure such aspects from the students’ perspective and explore the differences among various subgroups of students. Design/methodology/approach: In the survey, students expressed their opinions on 13 different aspects (a seven-level scale) of the e-courses in which they were enroled. In addition, the influence of some demographic characteristics was analysed. The authors used statistical tests (t-test and ANOVA) to compare the means among the analysed subgroups. Findings: The empirical results reveal some differences among the subgroups of students. Students’ attitudes to blended learning increase significantly by year of study and decrease according to the amount of other non-study activities. Simplicity of finding materials in an e-course is the factor where male and female students differ significantly. This finding serves as a guideline for faculty management concerned with how to adjust blended learning to fulfil the various expectations of different student subgroups. Originality/value: This paper’s insights will be of value to individuals and institutions engaged in the e-learning process in higher education. In particular, the results will be helpful to the faculty management and teachers with the main task to increase the engagement of particular groups of students regarding the work in e-courses. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; Demographic factors; Higher education; LMS Moodle; Public administration education; Students’ perspective",,"Al-Adwan, A., Al-Adwan, A., Smedley, J., Exploring students’ acceptance of e-learning using technology acceptance model in Jordanian universities (2013) International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology, 9 (2), pp. 4-18; Boling, E.C., Hough, M., Krinsky, H., Saleem, H., Stevens, M., Cutting the distance in distance education: perspectives on what promotes positive, online learning experiences (2012) Internet in Higher Education, 15 (2), pp. 118-126; Bostrom, C., Educational leadership and the e-learning paradigm (2012) Global Partners in Education Journal, 2 (1), pp. 42-56; Clark, R.C., Meyer, R.E., (2011) E-Learning and The Science of Instruction: Proven Guidelines for Consumers and Designers of Multimedia Learning, , Pfeiffer, New York, NY; Friesen, N., (2012) Report: defining blended learning, , http://learningspaces.org/papers/Defining_Blended_Learning_NF.pdf, February 2016, :, (accessed; Hart, C., Factors associated with student persistence in an online program of study: a review of literature (2012) Journal of Interactive Online Learning, 11 (1), pp. 19-42; Hassanzadeh, A., Kanaani, F., Elahi, S., A model for measuring e-learning systems success in universities (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (12), pp. 10959-10966; Islam, A., Rahim, N.A.A., Liang, T.C., Momtaz, H., Effect of demographic factors on e-learning effectiveness in a higher learning institution in Malaysia (2011) International Education Studies, 4 (1), pp. 112-121; Islam, A.K.M.N., Investigating e-learning system usage outcomes in the university context (2013) Computers & Education, 69, pp. 387-399; Johnson, R.D., Hornik, S., Salas, E., An empirical examination of factors contributing to the creation of successful e-learning environments (2007) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 66 (5), pp. 356-369; Joo, Y.J., Joung, S., Son, H.S., Structural relationships among effective factors on e-learners’ motivation for skill transfer (2014) Computers in Human Behavior, 32, pp. 335-342; Kassab, S.E., Al-Shafei, A.I., Salem, A.H., Otoom, S., Relationship between the quality of blended learning experience, self-regulated learning, and academic achievement of medical students: a path analysis (2015) Advances in Medical Education in Practice, 6, pp. 27-34; Liaw, S.-S., Investigating students’ perceived satisfaction, behavioural intention, and effectiveness of e-learning: a case study of the blackboard system (2008) Computers & Education, 51 (2), pp. 864-873; Lim, Y.M., Ayesh, A., Chee, K.N., Socio-demographic differences in the perceptions of learning management system (LMS) design (2013) International Journal of Software Engineering & Applications, 4 (5), pp. 15-35; Loveland, K.A., Student evaluation of teaching (SET) in web-based classes: preliminary findings and a call for further research (2007) The Journal of Educators Online, 4 (2), pp. 1-18; Mbarek, R., Zaddem, F., The examination of factors affecting e-learning effectiveness (2013) International Journal of Innovation and Applied Studies, 2 (4), pp. 423-435; Ozkan, S., Koseler, R., Multi-dimensional students’ evaluation of e-learning system in the higher education context: an empirical investigation (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (4), pp. 1285-1296; Padilla-Melendez, A., Aguilla-Obra, A.R., Garrido-Moreno, A., Perceived playfulness, gender differences and technology acceptance model in a blended learning scenario (2013) Computers & Education, 63, pp. 306-317; Park, S.Y., An analysis of the technology acceptance model in understanding university students’ behavioural intention to use e-learning (2009) Education al Technology and Society, 12 (3), pp. 150-162; Pekkarinen, T., (2012) Gender differences in education, , ftp.iza.org/dp6390.pdf, October 2016, Discussion Paper 6390, IZA, Bonn: :, (accessed; Saba, T., Implications of e-learning systems and self-efficiency on students’ outcomes: a model approach (2012) Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 2 (6), pp. 1-11; Severiens, S.E., Ten Dam, G.T.M., Gender differences in learning styles: a narrative review and quantitative meta-analysis (1994) Higher Education, 27 (4), pp. 487-501; Sheehan, E.P., DuPrey, T., Student evaluations of university teaching (1999) Journal of Instructional Psychology, 26 (3), pp. 188-194; Sun, P.-C., Tsai, R.J., Finger, G., Chen, Y.-Y., What drives a successful e-learning?

In China, new higher education (HE) teachers often lack teaching experience because there are limited teaching opportunities during their postgraduate studies. This status quo may compromise the quality of teaching and learning in higher education institutions. In 2013, Shanghai Municipal Education Commission initiated a professional development program for new teachers from all local higher education institutions. This article examines their ICT professional development through the lens of Kirkpatrick's evaluation model. Data were collected from online surveys both immediately after an ICT module and 6 months later. The results showed that participants intended to integrate ICT in teaching and had an above-average level of Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK). Participants and their department heads also confirmed distinctive teaching performance of these new teachers and better learning behavior of their students. The study revealed that demographic variables of new HE teachers may also affect their perception of ICT and TPACK.

This methodological study investigates the impact of the provision of lecture choice (online or f2f) on overall student achievement and course engagement. This research uses a within-group design to obtain baseline data on a single set of physics students (n=168), and investigates the impact of providing a lecture viewing choice (online, f2f) mid-semester on student achievement (tests, homework, and standardized conceptual evaluation scores), and course engagement (student lecture viewing, homework submissions, bonus project submissions, and note taking behaviors). The study reveals that the type of lecture does not serve to significantly impact overall student achievement or engagement. However, although recorded and f2f lectures demonstrate an overall educationally equivalent impact, students who elect a high level of recorded lecture use were significantly lower performing and less engaged before the option to watch recorded lectures was introduced and largely continued to be so after the option was introduced, but there was evidence of a reduction in achievement and engagement differences after the option is introduced. Therefore, results of this study suggest weaker performing students self-select higher levels of recorded lecture use, and the use of these video lectures may assist this specific group of students in closing the gap between themselves and students who were initially higher performing and more engaged. © 2015 Sloan Consortium.

Applications from games to augmented reality are thriving in research settings, and in some cases schools and universities, but relatively little is known about how such devices may be used for effective learning. This article discusses the selection and potential use of electronic games, simulations and augmented reality in mobile learning supported by an operational model called AIDLET. After analyzing the different approaches to the use of digital technology and games in education, and discussing their benefits and shortcomings, a framework was developed to facilitate the selection, repurposing, design and implementation of games, simulations and augmented reality, with focus on the practical aspects of the processes used in mobile learning. It is apparent that these devices for learning are valued by students and teachers alike, and that they may be used as personalized devices for amplifying learning, specifically through amplifying access to information, social networks, and ability to participate in the world. Furthermore, whereas traditional learning is based on knowledge memorization and the completion of carefully graded assignments, today, games, simulations and virtual environments turn out to be safe platforms for trial and error experimentation, i.e. learning by doing or playing. In this context, the AIDLET model was set out and verified against a taxonomy representing the main categories and genres of games, and the article concludes with implications for how teachers, instructional designers and technologists might best capitalize on the affordances of mobile devices when designing for blended learning and e-learning courses. © 2013, IGI Global.","AIDLET Model; Augmented Reality; e-Learning; Games; Mobile Learning; Simulations",,"Anderson, T., Teaching in an online learning context (2008) Theory and Practice of Online Learning, pp. 343-366. , In T.

The e-courses vary in their structure, assignments, prompt examinations, interaction between students and teachers, etc. Such aspects may influence the students’ perception of usefulness of blended learning. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors which influence that feeling and to look for possible differences in perception by different subgroups of students. Design/methodology/approach: Students in the survey evaluated 13 aspects of e-courses in which they were enrolled. From enrolment documents, additional demographic data were collected (gender, high-school grade, study programme, etc.). A multiple linear regression was used with perceived usefulness as the response variable and the 12 other e-course aspects as predictors. Further, the same regression analysis was performed on different subgroups of students based on demographical data. Findings: The empirical results showed that the general impression regarding the e-courses, their consistency with the face-to-face teaching and the teachers’ responsiveness had a significant influence on the students’ perception of the usefulness of e-courses. Further analysis based on demographic data revealed several subgroups of students where the perception of usefulness was influenced by different aspects. The teachers’ feedback and supplementing the tutorial play an important role in higher years of study, while the general impression loses its influence. Originality/value: The paper is the first to explore the importance of demographic determinants of perceived usefulness of e-learning tools in EAPAA (European Association of Public Administration Accreditation)-accredited undergraduate public administration programmes. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; Higher education; Moodle LMS; Public administration education; Questionnaire analysis; Students’ perceived usefulness",,"Al-Adwan, A., Al-Adwan, A., Smedley, J., Exploring students’ acceptance of e-learning using technology acceptance model in Jordanian universities (2013) International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology, 9 (2), pp. 4-18; Alexander, S., Golja, T., Using students’ experiences to derive quality in an e-learning system: an institution’s perspective (2007) Educational Technology & Society, 10 (2), pp. 17-33; Batagelj, V., Mrvar, A., (2016) Pajek: analysis and visualization of large networks, , http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/; Carvalho, A., Areal, N., Silva, J., Students’ perceptions of Blackboard and Moodle in a Portuguese university (2011) British Journal of Educational Technology, 42 (5), pp. 824-841; Dečman, M., Modeling the acceptance of e-learning in mandatory environments of higher education: the influence of previous education and gender (2015) Computers in Human Behavior, 49, pp. 272-281; Elkaseh, A.M., Wong, K.W., Fung, C.C., Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of social media for e-learning in Libyan Higher Education: a structural equation modeling analysis (2016) International Journal of Information and Education Technology, 6 (3), pp. 192-199; Ellis, R.A., Ginns, P., Piggot, L., E-learning in higher education: some key aspects and their relationship to approaches to study (2009) Higher Education Research & Development, 28 (3), pp. 303-318; Fructerman, T.M., Reingold, E.M., Graph drawing by force-directed placement (1991) Software: Practice and Experience, 21 (11), pp. 1129-1164; Hall, C., (2006) Lighting a fire or filling a pail?

Methodology This study employed a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design consisting of two groups: the treatment condition (sections in which instructors imple-mented the flipped classroom model for the module that was the focus of the study) and control condition (sections in which instructors lectured in the face-to-face meeting, then learners completed the practice online as homework). Learners in each group received their form of instruction and completed the same instructional activities, tests, and surveys. These data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Analysis of Covari-ance (ANACOVA) models. Contribution This research adds to a growing base of literature on the flipped classroom, a special instantiation of blended learning. Findings Results indicated that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of learner achievement. In terms of learner satisfaction, how-ever, there was a significant difference in which participants favored the control condition. Recommendations for Practitioners Practitioners should select situations that are appropriate for the flipped class-room context. This should be reflected in the implementation of curriculum that would benefit from the affordances of this approach. Recommendation for Researchers Researchers should seek to replicate this study in longer durations and using rigorously developed and validated measures. Impact on Society This study suggests the flipped classroom may not be perceived by learners in an introductory technology literacy course as beneficial to their satisfaction.

Nevertheless, the use of technology and open educational resources (OER) promote greater efficiency and social penetration. The objective of this research is to analyze how the attributes of innovation develop when OER are integrated with learning environments that promote digital skills. Case study and data recollection were applied to the interview, the log, the observation, and the document analysis. Results indicated that a combination of innovation attributes generates a change in: a) educational methodology, b) technological tools and ways to present its contents, and c) the way the teacher thinks and students act. The use of innovative elements allowed subjects to overcome space and time barriers, setting the foundation for the development of blended learning in the institution. © 2016, The Author(s).","Collaborative work; Digital competencies; Educational innovation; Open educational resources (OER); Web 2.0 tools",,"ACRL, (2000) Information literacy competency standards for higher education, , http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/standards/standards.pdf, Retrieved from; Anafo, P., Filson, C., (2014) Promoting information literacy among undergraduate students of Ashesi University College, Ghana, , http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/1032, Library Philosophy and Practice (e-journal).

The role of soft skills in terms of personal growth, employability, social development, social participation, change adaptation, etc. has been widely acknowledged although there is no agreement regarding the differential importance of some soft skills over others. However, the latter point is relative given that it depends on the field of reference. Despite the fact that these competencies are highly valued in the labor market, universities seem to overlook this demand throughout students’ education process and the development and assessment of these competencies have been given but scant attention. Further, the increasing emphasis on the use of ICTs in university education and a gradual trend towards blended-learning and virtual environments have prevented the development of these competencies as they are thought to require face-to-face interaction amongst classmates and between students and teachers. This study presents the results of an innovative proposal that intends to break these barriers by focusing on promoting the learning and assessment of team work skills in virtual environments. These results prove the suitability of the program when it comes to developing and evaluating these skills in a b-learning environment. © 2016, The Author(s).","Blended-learning; Problem-based learning; Soft skills; Team work",,"Álvarez, M.L., Fidalgo, R., Arias-Gundín, O., La eficacia de las metodologías activas en el rendimiento del alumnado de magisterio (2009) Actas do X Congresso Internacional Galego-Português de Psicopedagogia, , Universidade do Minho, Braga; (2006) «Definición de competencias específicas y genéricas del ingeniero en informática», , http://di002.edv.uniovi.es/~albizu/articulos/ice06b.pdf, Aquilino AJ, de Andrés J, Nieto C y otros [artículo en línea].

Dialogic learning was introduced to a unit of study taken by a final-year cohort of students in an initial teacher education degree at an urban university in Australia. Various opportunities for dialogue were designed into the unit through blended learning such as face-to-face tutorials, social networks and Viva Voce contexts. In the face of mixed opinion on their efficacy, the author profiles the use of social networks as a means of incorporating more interactive discourse through Web 2.0 platforms in higher education. The mixed-methods study reports on data collected from focus group interviews run at the end of the semester. An analytical framework based on Alexander’s principles of dialogic learning is used to interrogate the data set. The results illustrate the positive impact that dialogue employed as a pedagogic tool had on the value students perceived of their learning experience. It is recommended that designs for learning in higher education incorporate iterative exchanges across a variety of blended learning contexts to encourage productive interactions between students, peers and tutors. © 2015 Alyson Simpson.","blended learning; dialogic learning; higher education; pedagogy; social networks",,"Ahola, S., (2000) Hidden curriculum in higher education – Something to fear for or comply to?, , Paper presented at the Innovations in Higher Education conference, Helsinki, Finland:; Alexander, R., (2000) Culture and pedagogy: International comparisons of primary education, , London: Blackwell; Alexander, R., (2004) Towards dialogic teaching: Rethinking classroom talk, , 4th ed., Cambridge: Dialogos; Alexander, R., Towards a comparative pedagogy (2009) International handbook of comparative education, pp. 923-942. , Cowen R., Kazamias A.M., (eds), London: Springer; (2012) National professional standards for teachers and the initial teacher education standards and guidelines, , http://www.teacherstandards.aitsl.edu.au/OrganisationStandards/Organisation; Barnes, D., Why talk is important (2010) English Teaching: Practice and Critique, 9 (2), pp. 7-10; Barron, B., When smart groups fail (2003) Journal of the Learning Sciences, 12, pp. 307-359; Bell, F., The agency of students, teachers and learning technologists (2009) ALT-J, Research in Learning Technology, 17 (2), pp. 73-74; Christie, F., (2002) Classroom discourse analysis: A functional perspective, , London: Continuum; Deng, L., Yuen, A., Blogs in pre-service teacher education: Exploring the participation issue (2013) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 22, pp. 339-356; Ellis, R.A., Calvo, R.A., Learning through discussions in blended environments (2004) Educational Media International, 41, pp. 263-274; Friesen, N., Lowe, S., The questionable promise of social media for education: Connective learning and the commercial imperative (2012) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 28, pp. 183-194; Hung, H., Yuen, S., Educational use of social networking technology in higher education (2010) Teaching in Higher Education, 15, pp. 703-714; Kirkwood, A., E-learning: You don't always get what you hope for (2009) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 18, pp. 107-121; Kreijns, K., Kirschner, P., Jochems, W., Identifying the pitfalls for social interaction in computer-supported collaborative learning environments: A review of the research (2003) Computers in Human Behavior, 19, pp. 335-353; Larivee, B., Transforming teaching practice: Becoming the critically reflective teacher (2000) Reflective Practice, 1, pp. 293-307; Lave, J., Wenger, E., (1991) Situated learning: Legitimate peripheral participation, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Lemke, J.L., Critical analysis across media: Games, franchises, and the new cultural order (2005) Approaches to critical discourse analysis, , Postigo L., (ed), Valencia: University of Valencia, CD-ROM; Love, K., Simpson, A., Online discussions in schools: Towards a pedagogical framework (2006) International Journal of Educational Research, 43, pp. 446-463; Luke, A., Critical literacy in Australia: A matter of context and standpoint (2000) Journal of Adult and Adolescent Literacy, 43, pp. 448-461; Mercer, N., (1995) The guided construction of knowledge: Talk amongst teachers and learners, , Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Mercer, N., (2000) Words and minds: How we use language to think together, , London: Routledge; Mercer, N., Sociocultural discourse analysis: Analysing classroom talk as a social mode of thinking (2004) Journal of Applied Linguistics, 1, pp. 137-168; Mercer, N., Littleton, K., Wegerif, R., Methods for studying the processes of interaction and collaborative activity in computer-based educational activities (2004) Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 13, pp. 195-212; Merriam, S.B., (2001) Qualitative research and case study applications in education, , San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass; Michell, M., Sharpe, T., Collective instructional scaffolding in English as a Second Language classrooms (2005) Prospect, 20, pp. 31-58; Noor Al-Deen, H., Hendricks, J., (2012) Social media usage and impact, , Plymouth: Lexington Books; Owen, M., Just a tool?

This article describes the evaluation phase of a blended course of English for general academic purposes (EGAP) targeting second-year undergraduate Japanese students mostly from the Faculties of Law, Letters, Economics, and Human Sciences at Osaka University. In this study, the researchers adopted an inclusive approach to blended course evaluation. In order to ensure the course quality from the outset, the Fifth Edition of Quality Matters Higher Education Course Design Rubric was utilized as the major reference. As part of the evaluation process, students’ perception on the usefulness of the course was also measured quantitatively and qualitatively through an attitudinal survey instrument and open ended reflection questions. Eventually, to add an outsider positionality, the blended course was peer-reviewed by a certified reviewer from Quality Matters (QM) after having been self-reviewed by the researchers. The findings of the evaluation survey demonstrated students’ overall satisfaction with the course, and their responses to the open-ended questions provided further insight into the educational and technical difficulties they encountered. The QM peer review also yielded a score of 70 out of 99, resulting in failure to meet the essential standards. However, comments from the peer reviewer guided the refinements and improvement of the course design, and the course currently meets all the requirements of the Higher Education Course Design Rubric (Fifth Edition) upon amendment. This study discusses the implications for design, development, and evaluation of English-as-a-foreign-language blended courses and provides practical tips for online/blended course designers. Further refinements to the existing course can be made in the future by implementing it several times with various groups of students. © 2019, The Author(s).","Blended learning; English for general academic purposes; Evaluation; Quality Matters",,"Adair, D., A process to improve course design: A key variable in course quality (2014) Assuring Quality in Online Education: Practices and Processes at the Teaching, Resource, and Program Levels, pp. 81-90. , K.

More and more of these programmes and courses are designed as blended learning and are characterised by a short time cycle of design, delivery and completion. Despite a recent addition of learning design expertise to the organisation, there is a predominant tendency in design processes to focus on the technical setup, the content and the participants, and very little on the role of the teachers. The teachers’ role is challenged by a number of issues in relation to the growing use of blended and online learning, e.g. the task of facilitating the learning processes of the participants in new ways; a higher degree of exposure as the teacher often becomes the sole point of contact in online environments; communication skills needed to facilitate dialogue and collaboration in an online environment; etc. Furthermore, involvement of teaching staff in co-creation of new learning designs require skills which many lecturers do not have when they enter the design team for the first time, among others skills to articulate their pedagogical principles and technological imagination. Over time, we in our roles as learning designers in the School of Continuing Education have developed, tested and refined a technique for user involvement in the design work, and teachers now work with our professional learning designer and course producer on redesigning courses or creating new module or courses. In these collaborative design processes, we have identified a number of challenges, which will be dealt with in our paper. © 2018 The Author(s).","Blended learning; Collaborative design; Continuing education; Learning design; Role of the teacher; Short programs",,"Beetham, H., Sharpe, R., (2007) Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age: Designing and Delivering E-Learning, , Routledge, London: New York; Britain, S., A Review of Learning Design: Concept (2004) Specifications and Tools, , Report for the JISC E-learning Pedagogy Programme; Buus, L., The learning potentials and challenges when integrating Web 2.0 in a problem-based learning approach (2015) Aalborg Univeristy; Christensen, O., Christiansen, R.B., Gynther, K., Helms, N.H., Schlüntz, D., (2014) Kan Vi lære Af De Andre? – Udenlandske Erfaringer Med e-læring Og Blended Learning I Erhvervsuddannelser Og læreruddannelser for erhvervsskolelærere, , University College Sjælland; Conole, G., (2013) Designing for Learning in an Open World, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-8517-0, Springer: New York, NY; Conole, G., Describing learning activities-Tools and resources to guide practice (2007) In: Rethinking Pedagogy for a Digital Age: Designing and Delivering E-Learning, pp. 81-91. , Routledge, New York: London; Dohn, N.B., Teaching with wikis and blogs: Potentials and pitfalls (2010) Proceedings of the 7Th International Conference on Networked Learning.

The research that supported the design of this model was framed by a Grounded Theory method, combining different approaches to empirical data collection with a review of evaluation models on aspects of the quality of Online and Distance Learning. Throughout the paper, arguments are made that Higher Education institutions need to be more critical with regard to the use of Technology-Enhanced Learning, and to support it as a counterpart to face-to-face learning and teaching. The model provides a framework for teachers in Higher Education to reflect and discuss the quality of Technology-Enhanced Learning in their Blended Learning programmes.

As the demand for online learning grows, it is critical that tertiary education institutes (TEIs) address gaps in knowledge by developing their understandings of EOT applications. This paper aimed to identify, and describe the application of a range of EOTs popularly used in blended tertiary environments (BTEs). Through qualitatively designed semi-structured interviews with 13 blended learning experts from New Zealand, Australia and Canada, and a 5-step analyses of data, it verified the use of 35 different EOTs in BTEs, including Adobe Connect, Blackboard, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Their key characteristics were summarised using a multi-dimensional taxonomy, called the Pentexonomy, which synergised a range of perspectives into a robust, contextualised, and multidimensional framework for categorising EOTs. An outline of recommendations for the effective use of some of these EOTs was also provided. As EOTs advance and usage accelerates, the outcomes of this research will assist TEIs in their efforts to keep abreast of EOT developments, make informed choices about EOT use, and contribute to the delivery of relevant, meaningful EOT support.

The effects of this teaching model on student performance in terms of problem solving and learning attitudes were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Students in both groups completed assessments of problem-solving attitudes and learning attitudes both one week both before and after experimental instruction. Collected data were analyzed using one-way ANCOVA. Group discussions and student interviews were recorded and treated as part of the data analysis. Findings: The study produced the following findings: the experimental group was found to perform better than the control group in terms of learning attitudes, but the results were not statistically significant; the experimental group was found to outperform the control group in terms of problem-solving attitudes, and the difference was statistically significant; lesson plan contents need to be designed based on problem-based learning theory, and reflect real-world conditions; participants in the experimental group approved of the blended PBL and group discussion approach. Originality/value: Results are expected to provide a useful reference for educators and researchers. These findings can be applied to relevant instructional fields to enhance learner motivation and engagement, thus improving learning outcomes. © 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bioinformatics course; Blended learning; Learning attitude; Moodle; Problem-based learning; Problem-solving attitude",,"Abdulla, A.M., Watkins, L.O., Henke, J.S., Weitz, F.I., Frank, M.J., Classroom use of personal computers in medical education: a practical approach (1983) Medical Education, 17 (4), pp. 229-232; Chen, C.C., Chen, C.Y., Exploring the effect of learning styles on learning achievement in a u-museum (2017) Interactive Learning Environments, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2017.1385488; Chen, C.C., Huang, T.C., Learning in a u-museum: developing a context-aware ubiquitous learning environment (2012) Computers & Education, 59 (3), pp. 873-883; Chen, C.C., Lin, P.H., Development and evaluation of a context-aware ubiquitous learning environment for astronomy education (2016) Interactive Learning Environments, 24 (3), pp. 644-661; Cho, K.L., Jonassen, D.H., The effects of argumentation scaffolds on argumentation and problem solving (2002) Education Technology Research and Development, 50 (3), pp. 5-22; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., Attitudes and normative beliefs as factors influencing behavioral intentions (1972) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 21 (1), pp. 1-9; Heppner, P.P., Petersen, C.H., The development and implications of a personal problem-solving inventory (1982) Journal of Counseling Psychology, 29 (1), pp. 66-75; Huang, T.C., Chen, C.C., Chou, Y.W., Animating eco-education: to see, feel, and discover in an augmented reality-based experiential learning environment (2016) Computers & Education, 96 (C), pp. 72-82; McLinden, M., McCall, S., Hinton, D., Weston, A., Douglas, G., Developing online problem-based resources for the professional development of teachers of childrenwith visual impairment (2006) Open Learning, 21 (3), pp. 237-251; Rosenberg, M.J., (2001) E-Learning: Strategies for Delivering Knowledge in ther Digital Age, , McGraw-Hill, New York, NY; Schoenfeld, A.H., Herrmann, D.J., Problem solving and knowledge structure in expert and novice mathematical problem solvers (1982) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 8 (1), pp. 484-494; Singh, H., Building effective blended learning program (2003) Education and Technology, 43 (6), pp. 51-54; Singh, H., Reed, C., (2001), A white paper: achieving success with blended learning.

Background With an increasing number of K-12 students learning online within full-time online schools and in blended learning environments, universities must prepare future educators to teach in virtual environments including clinical practice. Be-fore engaging in online field placement, preservice teachers must be oriented to online K-12 teaching and learning. Methodology Using a design-based, mixed-method research methodology, this study drew samples from four sections of a hybrid technology integration course. Preserv-ice teachers' papers detailing their perceptions, focus groups, and surveys were used to gauge changes in perceptions of online learning after participating in online teaching and learning activities. Contribution The study demonstrated that an exposure to online K-12 classrooms stimulated preservice teachers' interest in online teaching as they began to feel that online education could be equivalent to traditional education. Findings Students' perceptions positively improved the equivalency of online learning to traditional schooling, the possibility of positive relationships between teachers and students, and the ability to create interactive learning. Students also report-ed being more knowledgeable and showed increased interest in participating in virtual field experiences. Future Research Future research may continue to examine if the exposure course, combined with a short-term clinical experiences and long-term online apprenticeships may serve to prepare graduates with the skills necessary to teach in classrooms of the future.","Online learning; Online schools; Online teaching; Preservice teachers; Virtual schools","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Distance education; E-learning; Education; Societies and institutions; Students; Virtual reality; Online learning; Online schools; Online teaching; Pre-service teacher; Virtual schools; Teaching","Anderson, T., Shattuck, J., Design-based research A decade of progress in education research?

For the purposes of this study, faculty governance was defined as formally established bodies in colleges and universities such as senates, councils, and collective bargaining organizations that are affiliated with the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). While there have been many studies on the perceptions of students, faculty, and administrators, there has been very little research on the perceptions of faculty governance leaders who hold critical positions in colleges and universities. Governance leaders are at the crux of approval processes that influence the development of curricula, faculty personnel policies, and academic programs, all of which can impact the implementation of online and blended learning initiatives. The research methodology for this study included a survey sent to a sample of governance leaders at U.S. institutions of higher education and follow-up phone interviews or email correspondence with a small number of volunteers. The sample was identified using an American Association of University Professors (AAUP) membership list. The results of this study provide important new information on the perceptions of this influential group of leaders on matters related to online and blended learning. © 2016, Sloan Consortium.

The focus at higher education institutions has been placed on embracing the ever-changing Web technologies to enhance teaching and learning. This case study reports on a collaborative effort between faculty and librarians in 2014, where tablet technology was integrated into the Information Literacy Certificate Programme of Environmental Management Extended Curriculum Programme (ECP) students. Design/methodology/approach: To support teaching with technology at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), a pilot project was conducted in 2014 using tablet technology to train IL to a group of 20 ECP Environmental Management students in the Applied Sciences Faculty. All modules were adapted for this purpose meaning that students used the tablet throughout the training sessions. Findings: Good collaboration between librarians and faculty, as well as interaction between students increased. Some of the challenges faced were unstable internet connection; many Web applications identified by the trainers to use during the training were not compatible with the Nexus 7 Tablet. Overall, the training went well. In the end, the librarians were successful in achieving learning to take place among students. Originality/value: Currently CPUT Libraries promotes the Information Literacy (IL) Certificate Programme to first year students, integrating IL into the curriculum of faculty. It is hoped that this paper will give insight for academic librarians wishing to incorporate mobile technologies into their IL training programmes. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; e-learning; Information literacy; Online learning environment; Student experience; Tablet technology",,"Aharony, N., Librarians’ attitudes towards mobile services (2013) Aslib Proceedings, 65 (4), pp. 358-375; Anderson, K., May, F., Does the method of instruction matter?

To gain knowledge about the ways in which the tutors experienced the phenomenon, a phenomenographic methodological framework was employed. Identified were four different ways of conceiving the online course as: A) a one-way street of communication: to provide students with extra materials to practice individually and for asynchronous communication, B) an add-on to on-campus classes; C) a distant relationship between students and online tutors; and D) an opportunity for tutor's professional development and team communication. The phenomenographic approach allowed to reveal variations of tutors' perceptions of teaching online with a view of enhancing the university curriculum. The findings may have implications for university teachers and educational designers.

Following the design research approach, we propose a framework for creating university courses that support content and language integrated learning (CLIL) within a virtual learning environment (VLE). The framework was developed on the basis of our experience and a survey conducted among students of Cracow University of Economics, Poland, who study in a non-native language. It incorporates a blended-learning model. All course materials are prepared in Polish and English and are available for multilingual student population in a bilingual VLE course. The framework might be useful for other transition economies where a political and economic transformation has brought similar shifts in language skill requirements. © 2015 Commonwealth Secretariat.","blended learning; CLIL; design research; e-learning; Poland; transition economy; VLE",,"Amiel, T., Reeves, T.C., Design-based research and educational technology: Rethinking technology and the research agenda (2008) Educational Technology & Society, 11 (4), pp. 29-40; Anderson, T., Shattuck, J., Design-based research: A decade of progress in education research?

Mathematics forms the core for engineering and science studies at institutions of higher learning. However, analysis of student's performance in mathematics tasks reveals that mastery of skills is not acquired. This paper focuses on students understanding of elementary calculus in a blended learning course at a University of Technology (UOT). Conventional lectures were integrated with the computer laboratory teaching environment to promote interactive and discovery learning. Projects were designed to support the development of calculus frames in conjunction with a theoretical framework that was used in analyzing students understanding of integral calculus concepts. The students in the blended learning mathematics course (experimental group) was also compared to students that were traditionally lectured (control group).

Most surveys measure responses to questions which are based on students' subjective impressions. The purpose of this study is to examine participants' assessments made during the transitional phase in an online learning environment which includes blended and fully online courses at a Japanese national university. Students were enrolled in two-unit Master's or Bachelor's degree courses which were taught by the same professor. The total number of students with valid survey data was 184 (92 Masters, 67 Bachelors for the blended learning course and 25 Bachelors for the fully online course). A survey questionnaire consisting of 10 questions measured the self-assessments of students' online learning experiences. Three factors were extracted. There are no significant differences in all factor scores between the beginnings and the ends of the courses. These results show the coherence of students' assessments during the course. The correlation coefficients of the first factor scores (e-learning evaluation) between the beginnings and the ends of the courses are not high, however (Masters: r=0.35, Bachelors for blended learning: r=0.46, and Bachelors for fully online: r=0.33). Therefore, some participants have changed their evaluations between the two surveys. When the differences in factor scores from the initial and final surveys are compared between students who rated the course highly at the beginning (high raters) and students who did not (low raters), the scores for the high raters decrease and the scores for the low raters increase. Also, the relationships between students' transitions and the metrics of their behaviour were investigated. © Academic Publishing International Ltd.","Assessment in transition; Blended learning; Fully online learning; Online learning; Student assessment",,"Anderson, J., Brown, G., Spaeth, S., Online Student Evaluations and Responses Rates Reconsidered (2006) Innovate, 2 (6). , http://www.innovateonline.info; Bates, A.W., (1999) Managing Technological Change, , Strategies for College and University Leaders, Jossey-Bass Publishers, San Francisco, USA; Coolican, H., (1994) Research Methods and Statistics In Psychology, , Hodder & Stoughton, London, UK; Craig, A., Goold, A., Coldwell, J., Mustard, J., Perceptions of Roles and Responsibilities inonline Learning: A Case Study (2008) Interdisciplinary Journal of E-Learning and Learning Object, 4, pp. 205-223; Deepwell, F., Embedding Quality in e-Learning Implementation through Evaluation (2007) Educational Technology & Society, 10 (2), pp. 34-43; Elton, L., University Teaching: A Professional Model for Quality (1993) Quality Assurance For University Teaching, pp. 133-146. , In R.

Thus, there is need for institutional-based research to guide universities, colleges, and polytechnics to strategically diffuse BL. Accordingly, this study develops a model to investigate the variables and associated factors that influence institutions' administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives based on Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory and institutional BL adoption framework that comprises of mature implementation stage of BL. Quantitative research approach was employed and data was collected using online survey questionnaire from 223 e-learning administrators/managers in Malaysia universities, colleges, and polytechnics. Next, Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was employed for data analysis. Results indicate that institutional structure, resource support, technology infrastructure, management strategies, and ethical considerations are key variables that positively predict administration readiness to diffuse BL initiatives in higher education. Additional results from Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) in PLS-SEM suggest that institutional structure has the strongest effect on administrators’ readiness to diffuse BL and is also the most important variable that influences BL diffusion in institutions. Theoretically, findings from this study provide insights on how institutions’ administration perception and acceptance of BL approach can be enhanced. Practically, the developed model can be employed as a readiness tool to assess institutions current state in implementing BL environment and further provides a road map for future improvement. © 2019, © 2019 ISTE.","administration readiness; blended learning; higher education policy; institutional diffusion; Technology in education",,"Ahmed, H.M.S., Hybrid E‐Learning acceptance model: Learner perceptions (2010) Decision Sciences Journal of Innovative Education, 8 (2), pp. 313-346; Al-Busaidi, K.A., Learners' perspective on critical factors to LMS success in blended learning: An empirical investigation (2012) Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 30 (2), pp. 11-34; Al-Rahmi, W.M., Alias, N., Othman, M.S., Alzahrani, A.I., Alfarraj, O., Saged, A.A., Rahman, N.S.A., Use of E-learning by university students in Malaysian Higher Educational Institutions: A case in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 14268-14276; Alshehri, A.F., Student satisfaction and commitment towards a blended learning finance course: A new evidence from using the investment model (2017) Research in International Business and Finance, 41, pp. 423-433; Anthony, B., Jr., Green information system integration for environmental performance in organizations: An extension of belief–action–outcome framework and natural resource-based view theory (2019) Benchmarking: An International Journal, 26 (3), pp. 1033-1062; Anthony, B., Jr., Abdul Majid, M., Romli, A., A collaborative agent based green IS practice assessment tool for environmental sustainability attainment in enterprise data centers (2018) Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 31 (5), pp. 771-795; Anthony, B., Abdul Majid, M., Romli, A., Heterogeneous agent-enabled decision system for evaluating green IT performance in industrial environments (2018) Journal of Decision Systems, 27 (1), pp. 37-62; Anthony, B., Kamaludin, A., Romli, A., Raffei, A.F.M., Abdullah, A., Ming, G.L., Baba, S., Exploring the role of blended learning for teaching and learning effectiveness in institutions of higher learning: An empirical investigation (2019) Education and Information Technologies, pp. 1-34. , …; Anthony, B., Majid, M.A., Romli, A., Green IS diffusion in organizations: A model and empirical results from Malaysia (2018) Environment, Development and Sustainability, pp. 1-42; Baragash, R.S., Al-Samarraie, H., Blended learning: Investigating the influence of engagement in multiple learning delivery modes on students’ performance (2018) Telematics and Informatics, 35 (7), pp. 2082-2098; Basir, H.M., Ahmad, A., Noor, N.L.M., Institutional strategy for effective blended e-learning: HCI perspective of sustainable embedding (2010) IEEE, pp. 71-76. , Shah Alam, Malaysia:, &; Bervell, B., Umar, I.N., Blended learning or face-to-face?

Furthermore, previous scholars also highlighted that limited studies were conducted to understand how student interactions and student engagement predicts the learning outcomes among students. Hence, this study is conducted with the aim to develop a quality framework in blended learning by incorporating two new variables namely student engagement and student interactions in entrepreneurship education context. Students interactions were measured using studentcontent, student-instructor and student–student interactions, Data were collected using survey based approach among diploma student in a public university in Malaysia. 281 questionnaires were qualified for further analysis. Data were analyzed using SmartPLS. A two-step approach was used to explain the measurement model and structural model for this study. The findings shows that student engagement has significant relationship with the dimension of student interactions (student-content, student-instructor, and student–student), two dimensions of student interactions have significant relationship with satisfaction. However, student-instructor appears to be insignificant to satisfaction. Conclusions and recommendations for the study also presented. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

This article reports on the current experience of a higher education institution embarking on blended learning models. The aim of this article is to present a case study and to discuss the strategic approach to integrating a MOOC at undergraduate level. The evaluation strategy of this experience uses surveys and focus groups to interpret the results and the perspective of the various stakeholders. The analysis synthesizes the opinion of the main stakeholders - the institution, the students and the academic staff - and shows that in addition to improving the financial viability of MOOCs, blended learning models improve the quality of students' education, strengthen students' academic performance, and encourage academic staff to constantly innovate their teaching and learning process.

Thus, the main objective of this research was to determine the user expectations of e-learning websites of comprehensive universities through localisation based on user preferences. This research showed how users interact with e-learning websites and indicated the patterns that can be used as standard guidelines to design the best e-learning websites. It was found localisation of e-learning websites was scarce and slow interaction with e-learning websites has inconvenienced users. Additionally, too many web objects on the user interface of e-learning websites have a tendency to confuse users. A mixed method approach was used I this study, namely content analysis (qualitative) and localisation (quantitative). Thus, this research contributes to knowledge by guiding users on localising their web objects according to their preferences and hopefully allow for an easy and quick information search for e-learning websites. © 2017 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","E-learning; Localisation; User expectations; Web objects",,"Adkisson, H.P., Identifying de-facto standards for e-commerce Web sites (2002) Proceedings.

The article describes a model of a laboratory course that includes a virtual component. This virtual component is viewed as a tool of student pre-lab autonomous learning. It presents electronic resources designed for a virtual laboratory and outlines the methodology of e-resource application. To find out how virtual chemistry laboratory affects student scientific literacy, research skills and practices, a pedagogical experiment has been conducted. Student achievement was compared in two learning environments: traditional - in-class hands-on - learning (control group) and blended learning - online learning combined with in-person learning (experimental group). The effectiveness of integrating an e-lab in the laboratory study was measured by comparing student lab reports of the two groups. For that purpose, a set of 10 criteria was developed. The experimental and control student groups were also compared in terms of test results and student portfolios. The study showed that the adopted approach blending both virtual and hands-on learning environments has the potential to enhance student research skills and practices in analytical chemistry studies. © 2017, Association for Learning Technology.

As this is a new phenomenon, there are limitations and constraints on theoretical sampling to support the phenomenon. Thus, the grounded theory approach is being suggested to support the formulation of the theoretical framework of understanding the phenomenon. The main objective of this research is to propose a research framework for framing Grounded Theory Method (GT) in blended learning adoption patterns. The Grounded Theory Method (GTM) is presented as a method having both phenomenological and positivistic roots. A social constructionist version and application of grounded theory will be used.

Mobile learning is supported by various technologies such as via voice communication, learning portal on the web, short message service (SMS) and also social media. Mobile technologies are now more established, ubiquitous and interconnected. There are problems in the current learning environment that is too rigid to new generation student in the 21st century that only focused for teacher-centered learning and limit students’ potential to be flexible, creative and innovative. Mobile learning is still under research by educators and researchers in Malaysia. Mobile learning is still in new in Malaysia because the studies on it are still in the circle of establishing idea, theory, design, types of learning and activities using mobile technologies. The main objective of this study is to investigate the mobile learning readiness among undergraduate students. One local university in Malaysia is being selected as a case study. A survey questionnaire was conducted involving 302 undergraduate students from a non-IT faculty at a local university in November 2015 as a case study. A test of independent using Mann-Whitney U Test was conducted by adopting Technology Readiness Index 2.0 to test the significant different between the technology readiness index dimensions towards students’ group of experience using mobile devices and type of students’ groupings (junior/senior). The findings revealed that readiness level varies according to different dimensions of Technology Readiness Index 2.0 (TRI 2.0) and varies based on experience on using mobile devices and students’ groupings (junior/senior). The findings provide motivations for policy and guideline development associated with the implementation of mobile learning for non-IT students in the blended learning environment in Malaysia, that are customized based on experience of students using mobile devices and grouping of students (junior/senior). © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

Design/methodology/approach: The presented methodology is based on the main principles of flexible and blended learning. The authors considered three main aspects: student’s background, the level of knowledge and the most suitable style of learning. At the beginning of the course, students were randomly divided into reference and test group. The test group students were continuously supported by different tools within an e-learning environment. The learning process for the reference group students was held in a traditional form. Findings: The success of the experiment presented in this paper is demonstrated by comparing the results of the test group who were taught using the new strategy with the reference group who were taught in a common way. The statistical analysis shows that the test group students had better achievements compared to the reference group. Research Limitations/implications: This presented study was carried out with non-IT first-year university students from social sciences, economics and technical faculties. Each year the number of students varied from 150 to 300. Originality/value: Based on developed methodology, the model of individualization of the educational process in an e-environment was created and implemented in the course of Informatics in Tallinn University of Technology. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Curricula; E-Learning; Teaching methods",,"Broadbent, B., (2002) ABCs of e-Learning: Reaping the Benefits and Avoiding the Pitfalls, , 1st ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY; (2015) AP computer science principles, , https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles, accessed, 4 May 2015; (2015) Computational thinking task force, , http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/CompThinking.html, accessed, 2 May 2015; (2015) ECDL foundation, , www.ecdl.com, accessed, 1 May 2015; Felder, R., Brent, R., Understanding students differences (2005) Journal of Engineering Education, 94 (1), pp. 57-72; Felder, R.M., Spurlin, J.E., Applications, reliability, and validity of the index of learning styles (2005) International Journal of Engineering Education, 21 (1), pp. 103-112; (2014) Project-based learning, , www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning, accessed, 24 November 2014; (2015) Khan academy, , www.khanacademy.org/, accessed, 3 May 2015; Kolb, D., (1984) Experimental Learning, , Prentice Hall, Engle Cliffs; (2015) Scratch – imagine, program, share, , http://scratch.mit.edu/, accessed, 6 May 2015; (2015) Open-source learning platform | Moodle.org, , https://moodle.org/, accessed, 6 May 2015; Palmer, S.R., The lived experience of flexible education – theory, policy and practice (2011) Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice, 8 (3)",,,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",,,,,17415659,,,"English",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982899283

First, the importance of a flexible, curriculum-based approach to BL is examined, based on a review of the literature. Experimentation with blended English language courses for part-time students began in 2002 and in 2005 the open-source learning platform, Moodle, was adopted due to the interactive tools available, making it possible to create learner-centered activities based on a collaborative approach. A description is given of the role BL has played in adult professional training at the university and how it provides a flexible solution for meeting the needs of degree course programs for students. With a view toward good practice, a detailed description of a currently offered blended course is given, including comparative data of the same course taught traditionally in the classroom with results indicating student performance for both courses during the period of an academic year. Moreover, a range of competencies is necessary to prepare students for the workplace, such as providing them with skills in intercultural communication and digital literacies, which can be indirect benefits from the adoption of a blended methodology. The study concludes with reflections for the future. © 2016, Italian e-Learning Association.

The present article reports the development and testing of a novel questionnaire on 'approaches to e-teaching', which may be employed to investigate the experience of teaching when e-learning is involved. Results showed suitable reliability and validity. Also, when exploring associations between the novel questionnaire scales and those of the well-known 'approaches to teaching' inventory (Prosser and Trigwell, 2006), results from correlation and cluster analyses suggest that student-focused approaches to teaching are needed for significant use of digital technology to emerge. For practice, this relevant outcome implies that teaching needs to be considered holistically when supporting teachers to incorporate e-learning in their practice: because it seems they approach online teaching coherently with the face-to-face side of the blended experience. © 2013 Vilnius University.","Approaches to teaching; E-learning; E-teaching; Higher education.",,"Biggs, J., Kember, D., Leung, D.Y.P., The revised two-factor study process questionnaire: R-SPQ-2F (2001) British Journal of Educational Psychology, 71, pp. 133-149; Bliuc, A.M., Ellis, R., Goodyear, P., Piggott, L., Learning through face-to-face and online discussions: associations between students' conceptions, approaches and academic performance in political science (2010) British Journal of Educational Technology, 41 (3), pp. 512-524; Bliuc, A.M., Ellis, R.A., Goodyear, P., Piggott, L., A blended learning approach to teaching foreign policy: student experiences of learning through face-to-face and online discussion and their relationship to academic performance (2011) Computers and Education, 56 (3), pp. 856-864; Bowden, J.A., Walsh, E., (2000) Phenomenography, , Melbourne, RMIT University Press; DeVellis, R.F., (2003) Scale Development: Theory and Applications 2nd edn, , Thousand Oaks, Calif., Sage Publications, Inc; Ellis, R., Ginns, P., Piggott, L., E-learning in higher education: some key aspects and their relationship to approaches to study (2009) Higher Education Research and Development, 28 (3), pp. 303-318; Ellis, R., Goodyear, P., (2010) Students' Experiences of E-Learning in Higher Education.

The authors describe how blended learning can form an attractive and helpful framework for assisting Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (D-HH) students to learn and communicate. The described blended learning experiment integrates face-to-face, synchronous, and asynchronous e-learning, bilingual teaching (oral language and Sign Language) in the mainstream class, teaching in parallel classes, and personalized access to distributed databases of educational material. At the core of PELE, the authors use Multimedu, a web-based tailored made tool for disabled students. This experimental tool includes applications of a traditional Learning Management System (LMS), supporting a multilingual dictionary of terms, multimedia management and social networking. Finally, this paper describes the use of the blended e-learning model in ""Database I"" course, given at the Technological Educational Institute of Athens, Greece.

We analyze this example of how diversity can be an asset and how learning management systems can act as mediators to overcome the challenges of diversity and the barriers of emotional isolation. We were carrying out a participatory action research project, within a blended learning environment supported by Moodle, to develop collaborative and personal pedagogical strategies to improve the inclusion and engagement of higher education students in their own learning and evaluation. We were using content analysis of the online discussions held by the students, of the reflective descriptions of the classes, of the students' e-portfolios, and of the interviews with the students.

The question is whether this will really contribute to creating a community in a situation where people have little opportunities to have contact and exchange ideas and practices. Tutor support and careful induction sessions will help make everyone more comfortable with the new technology by showing the opportunities it opens up. Design/methodology/approach: The evidence taken into consideration refers to the initial phases of the project: leading a needs assessment survey and introducing library staff to the new system, both as learners and teachers. Courses have been organized and surveys have been drawn to collect the participants' impressions. Findings: Actually, it seems that learning is enhanced when related to real situations, and so is interaction and involvement of participants, notwithstanding age and background differences: this seems to be even more true for online environments. Research limitations/implications: This is a report about a particular experience from which is drawn a series of considerations useful for practice: it is not intended as a wide scope study on e-learning application to workplace learning and development. Practical implications: The experience described here builds up a basis for a new mode of delivering learning experiences at work, while at the same time trying to create a sense of belonging and community. Originality/value: Though not aiming at drawing conclusive statements on the subject, the paper analyzes the impact of blended learning in an organizational environment where differences in age, education and relative isolation of single workers are the rule. This applies to most library systems and larger organizations, therefore the experience can build up a basis for critical thought in sketching workplace development plans for larger libraries and library systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Academic libraries; E-learning; Employee development; Workplace learning",,"Appelbaum, S.H., Serena, M., Shapiro, B.T., Generation X and the boomers: Organizational myths and literary realities (2005) Management Research News, 28 (1), pp. 1-33; Cennamo, L., Gardner, D., Generational differences in work values, outcomes and person-organisation values fit (2008) Journal of Managerial Psychology, 23 (8), pp. 891-906; Fontanin, M., Developing an English course for in-service librarians: The advantages of blended learning (2008) Library Management, 29 (8-9), pp. 777-788; Fontanin, M., Švab, M., Applying Moodle to continuing professional development.

The article discusses blended learning form of education with a focus on an innovative approach to content creation and a recommender system of learning material in e-courses. These two interconnected parts of e-courses are analysed on both a theoretical and practical basis resulting in the design of a recommender system model reflecting technical specifications of established learning management system at the university. The effort of educators to enhance students’ learning performance is run via active involvement of students into the process of education by means of creation, presentation and evaluation of study materials. This approach is based on elaborated guiding in the virtual space, in utilizing proper tools for communication, navigation and evaluation of students’ presentations. The evaluation of students’ presentations is made in the virtual space and also during face-to-face classes, for it is the inseparable part of the recommender system and as a whole corresponds to the blended learning concept. The pilot stage of implementation of the recommender system was tested during the last academic year. Students welcomed the new approach, earlier some students felt limited by time and others by lack of knowledge to evaluate which material is worth studying. Appropriateness of the model was demonstrated by reduced failure rate at the final tests. © 2019, Beijing Normal University.","Content development; Learning environment; Rating; Recommender system; Tourism management",,"Bloom, B.S., (1956) Taxonomy of educational objectives, handbook: The cognitive domain, , David McKay, New York; Bobadilla, J., Serradilla, F., Hernando, A., Collaborative filtering adapted to recommender systems of e-learning (2009) Knowledge-Based Systems, 22, pp. 261-265; Burke, R., Hybrid recommender systems: survey and experiments (2002) User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 12 (4), pp. 331-370; Cerna, M., User evaluation of geography website (2016) ECEL 2016, European conference on e-Learning, pp. 114-121. , Novotna J, (ed), Academic Conferences Ltd, Reading; Cerna, M., Utilization of social applications as a way of student’s engagement into a learning process (2017) Advanced Science Letters, 23 (4), pp. 2889-2893; Cerna, M., Psychodidactic approach in the development of language competences in university students within blended learning (2018) Open Learning: The Journal of Open, Distance and e-Learning, 33 (2), pp. 142-154; Černá, M., Borkovcová, A., Blended Learning Concept in Selected Tourism Management e-Courses with Focus on Content Development Including Recommender System (2018) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 175-187. , Springer International Publishing, Cham; Černá, M., Poulová, P., Reflection of Comenius’ didactic principles in ESP instruction (2013) ICIBET 2013: International Conference on Information, Business and Education Technology, 28, pp. 553-556. , Advances in Intelligent Systems Research, Paris: Atlantis Press; Cheung, S.K.S., Distance-Learning Students’ Perception on Usefulness of Open Educational Resources (2017) ICBL 2017, Blended Learning.

In this highly politicised and contested environment, some universities decided to use blended and online delivery as a strategy to enable the academic year to be completed and all curriculum to be covered, despite the disruptions. This was a controversial decision politically and a challenging one practically. From the perspective of the academics at the University of Cape Town (UCT), this paper draws on interviews with educators in three broad disciplinary areas to explore their views, practices, and experiences regarding the use of online materials in these unique circumstances. Activity Theory provides a framework to consider the issues systemically and to identify the tensions and contradictions in the system. © 2019, The Author(s).","#FeesMustFall; Activity theory; Blended learning; Contestations; Online education; Protests; South Africa; University of Cape Town",,"Adam, T., Digital neocolonialism and massive open online courses (MOOCs): colonial pasts and neoliberal futures (2019) Learning, Media and Technology, 44 (3), pp. 365-380; Badat, S., Deciphering the meanings and explaning the South African higher education students protests of 2015–16 (2016) Student and Scholar Protests in Africa Pax Academica, , Nyamjoh, F., Dakar, Senegal, Codesria; Bali, M., Caines, A., A call for promoting ownership, equity, and agency in faculty development via connected learning (2018) Int J Educ Technol Higher Educ, 15. , &, (,).,.,., https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-018-0128-8; Booysen, S., Fees must fall: Student revolt (2016) Decolonisation and Governance in South Africa, , Johannesburg, Wits University Press; Bosch, T., Twitter activism and youth in South Africa: the case of #RhodesMustFall (2016) Information, Communication & Society, 20 (2), pp. 221-232; Boyd, D., What would Paulo Freire think of blackboard: Critical pedagogy in an age of online learning (2016) Int J Crit Pedagogy, 7 (1), pp. 165-186. , http://libjournal.uncg.edu/ijcp/article/view/1055/892, Retrieved from; (2016) South African Higher Education Reviewed: Two Decades of Democracy, , https://www.che.ac.za/sites/default/files/publications/CHE_South%20African%20higher%20education%20reviewed%20-%20electronic.pdf, Pretoria: CHE; Chikane, R., Breaking a rainbow (2018) Building a Nation: The Politics behind #Mustfall Movements, , Johannesburg, Pan Macmillan; (2016) South African Higher Education Reviewed: Two Decades of Democracy, , Council on Higher Education, Pretoria; Czerniewicz, L., Brown, C., A study of the relationship between institutional policy, organisational culture and e-learning use in four South African universities (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (1), pp. 121-131; Czerniewicz, L., Haupt, G., Blended learning in challenging circumstances – The case of UCT (2018) Presented at the Carnegie Foundation Blended Learning Seminar, , www.siyaphumelela.org.za/documents/5c1234b7e354b.pdf, Ekurhuleni, South Africa, 1 June 2018; de Wet, T., van Rooyen, C., Frahm-Arp, M., Joshi, H., One tweak at a time: University of Johannesburg (2018) Presented at the Carnegie Foundation Blended Learning Seminar, , www.siyaphumelela.org.za/documents/5c1235670705c.pdf, Ekurhuleni, South Africa, 1 June 2018; (2018) Statistics on Post-School Education and Training in South Africa: 2016, , www.dhet.gov.za/DHET%20Statistics%20Publication/Statistics%20on%20Post-School%20Education%20and%20Training%20in%20South%20Africa%202016.pdf; Engeström, Y., (1987) Learning by expanding: An activity theoretical approach to developmental research, , Orienta-Konsultit, Helsinki; Fitzgerald, P., Seale, O., Between a rock and a hard place: University management and the #FeesMustFall campaign (2016) Fees must fall: Student revolt, decolonisation and governance in South Africa, pp. 235-255. , Booysen S, (ed), Wits University Press, Johannesburg; Habib, A., (2019) Rebels and rage: Reflecting on #FeesMustFall, , Jonathan Ball, Johannesburg; Hayes, S., Jandrić, P., Who is Really in Charge of Contemporary Education?

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional, cross-country survey study (n=319) was conducted recruiting participants from one North American and two British universities. The survey data and the conceptual model have been analysed and tested using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: Participants displayed positive attitudes towards the 3D game and responded positively to theory presented as “real-life” scenarios; gamification techniques such as interactions and dialogue, and rewards and progression levels, which are part of the game, albeit the participants’ adoption was driven more by extrinsic motivations (rewards) than intrinsic ones (ease of use and entertainment). In addition, the empirical results suggest that when gender is taken into account, the perceptions and needs of cross-cultural learners in serious gaming environments vary and display characteristics that are similar to Rogers’ five adopter categories; thus, culture could significantly shape learners’ decisions to adopt a serious game as a managerial learning tool. Research limitations/implications: For future researchers, this paper highlights various levels of training, support and promotional awareness that need to be considered to facilitate the adoption of serious games for managerial learning. Practical implications: For academics and practitioners in work-based learning and managerial training environments, this paper highlights the salient factors that need to be inherent in a serious 3D game, and best practices for scaffolding existing instructional approaches or training interventions. Originality/value: In light of Rogers’ five adopter categories, this cross-country study involving culturally diverse learners provides key insight into the potential application of serious games as a practice-based learning instrument in academia and industry. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption theory; Blended learning; Cross-cultural issue; Practice-based learning; Serious games; Technology adoption; Technology-mediated andragogy",,"Adler, N.J., Leading beautifully: the creative economy and beyond (2011) Journal of Management Inquiry, 20 (3), pp. 208-221; Afari, E., Aldridge, J.M., Fraser, B.J., Khine, M.S., Students perceptions of the learning environment and attitudes in game-based mathematics classrooms (2013) Learning Environments Research, 16 (1), pp. 131-150; Agarwal, R., Karahanna, E., Time flies when you’re having fun: cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (4), pp. 665-694; Ajzen, I., (1988) Attitudes, Personality and Behavior, , Open University Press, Milton Keynes; Ajzen, I., Perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy, locus of control, and the theory of planned behavior (2002) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 32 (4), pp. 665-683; Alavi, M., Yoo, Y., Vogel, D.R., Using information technology to add value to management education (1997) Academy of Management, 40 (6), pp. 1310-1333; Allal-Chérif, O., Makhlouf, M., Using serious games to manage knowledge: the SECI model perspective (2016) Journal of Business Research, 69 (5), pp. 1539-1543; Al-Senaidi, S., Lin, L., Poirot, J., Barriers to adopting technology for teaching and learning in Oman (2009) Computers & Education, 53 (3), pp. 575-590; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Assumptions and comparative strengths of the two-step approach comment on Fornell and Yi (1992) Sociological Methods & Research, 20 (3), pp. 321-333; Arbaugh, J., DeArmond, S., Rau, B.L., New uses for existing tools?

In that sense, systematically reviewing the methodological orientations represented in the research on Blended Learning in the thesis reports of Peruvian universities, contributes to a global knowledge about prioritized methodological approaches. For this purpose, 35 reports published in the last twelve years were selected, according to previously established criteria, which reveal the emerging scientific productivity, as well as the diversity of methodological trends. In this way, the emphasis on the quantitative research approach, primarily of experimental and correlational designs, applied not only to students but also to managers and teachers became evident. In these studies, the collection of information, preferably, was based on questionnaires created by the authors, and based on the Likert scale; as well as a predominance of the parametric tests in the verification of the hypothesis. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

The incorporation of sustainability into doctoral programs can be promoted using new learning methods through the practices carried out by the PhD students. These methods include learning by doing, blended learning, collaborative learning, and project based learning, all of which are presented in the practical experience described in this article. This study describes the training that students receive in the doctoral program “Energy Efficiency and Sustainability in Engineering and Architecture,” which is offered in the Engineering School at the University of Vigo. The study includes an analysis of the facility and its operations, the teaching methods used and the students' perceptions of sustainability's incorporation into the program. In this practice, students worked with an experimental facility that could be controlled and supervised both manually and remotely. Students performed numerous tasks, including studying the main problems related to the combustion of biomass and its impact on sustainable development. On the one hand, students have used different measuring devices to control and monitor facilities, and, on the other hand, they have discussed and analyzed data, thereby improving the work capacity with the facility equipment, team work skill and communication with each other effectively. As a conclusion, students showed sincere interest in development of the practice, and they participated actively in each of its phases. The learning methodology used was found to increase student motivation. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biomass; combustion; engineering teaching; learning methods; sustainability","Biomass; Combustion; Data communication equipment; Energy efficiency; Engineering education; Facilities; Learning systems; Sustainable development; Collaborative learning; Control and monitor; Engineering schools; Engineering teachings; Experimental facilities; Learning methods; Practical experience; Project based learning; Students","Lozano, R., Lukman, R., Lozano, F.J., Huisingh, D., Lambrechts, W., Declarations for sustainability in higher education: becoming better leaders, through addressing the university system (2013) J Cleaner Prod, 48, pp. 10-19; Crespo, B., Míguez-Álvarez, C., Arce, M.E., Cuevas, M., Míguez, J.L., The sustainable development goals: an experience on higher education (2017) Sustainability, 9 (8), p. 1353; Regueiro, A., Patiño, D., Míguez, C., Cuevas, M., A practice for engineering students based on the control and monitoring an experimental biomass combustor using labview (2017) Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 25 (3), pp. 392-403; Barth, M., Godemann, J., Rieckmann, M., Stoltenberg, U., Developing key competencies for sustainable development in higher education (2007) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 8 (4), pp. 416-430; Van Poeck, K., Vandenabeele, J., Learning from sustainable development: education in the light of public issues (2012) Environmental Education Research, 18 (4), pp. 541-552; Mälkki, H., Paatero, J.V., Curriculum planning in energy engineering education (2015) J Cleaner Prod, 106, pp. 292-299; Yoon, T.K., Kim, S., Takano, T., Yun, S.-J., Son, Y., Contributing to sustainability education of East Asian university students through a field trip experience: A social-ecological perspective (2016) Sustainability, 8 (10), p. 1067; Sterling, S., Learning for resilience, or the resilient learner?

This research first developed a framework for quantitatively assessing teachers’ online participation in BL, and then evaluated it with data produced by 7272 teachers in 15,128 BL courses in six universities across China. This evaluation adopted a mixed methods design to investigate the intensity, regularity and interactivity of these teachers’ online participation in BL. Three key findings emerged: 1) the framework effectively assessed the degrees and features of teachers’ online participation in BL implementation, 2) these results advanced our understanding of BL adoption stages, and 3) the proposed framework proved to be technically adequate in assessing teachers’ online participation in BL at an institutional level. Using this framework, institutions could gain a fuller picture of their BL implementation so as to refine their strategies and advance their BL agenda. © 2019","Blended learning; Blended learning adoption stages; Online teaching presence; Quantitative analysis, framework proposal; Teacher online participation","Computer applications; Internet; Blended learning; Higher education; Interactivity; Mixed method; Online participation; Online teaching; Quantitative assessments; E-learning","Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., Sizing the opportunity: The quality and extent of online education in the United States, 2002 and 2003 (2003) Sloan Consortium (NJ1), p. 6; Ally, M., Foundations of educational theory for online learning (2008) Theory and practice of online learning, pp. 15-44. , T.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an adaptive e-learning platform that enhances skills from primary school to university learners. Two purposes converge here: a pedagogical one – offering new possibilities, especially in terms of teaching scenarios (blended learning); and a research one – confirming the effectiveness of an adaptive e-learning tool in the case of individualized cross-disciplinary competences, such as comprehension of implicit information in written texts (French). Design/methodology/approach: The case study presented here concerns primary-school learners using the Implicit module of TACIT adaptive e-learning tool over the 2016-2017 academic year. Findings: This paper gives a first positive answer to the effectiveness of such a tool in this specific context. This pedagogical effectiveness is more pronounced for low-level pupils, especially for girls and for older pupils (CM1/CM2, respectively, fourth/fifth grade). Originality/value: In this case study, the module comes from an existing platform, created by the TACIT research group. The adaptive environment was created by using the Item Response Theory models and, more precisely, the Rasch model. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive environment; Blended learning; E-Learning Tools; Item response theory; Rasch model; Reading comprehension",,"Bangert, R., Kulik, J., Kulik, C., Individualized systems of instruction in secondary schools (1983) Review of Educational Research Summer, 53 (2), pp. 143-158; Benoit, K., (2011) Linear Regression Models with Logarithmic Transformations, , London School of Economics, London; Bianco, M., Megherbi, H., Sénéchal, M., Colé, P., Reading comprehension development: presentation of a special issue (2014) L’Année Psychologique, 114 (4), pp. 613-621; Black, P., Harrison, C., Lee, C., Marshall, B., William, D., (2003) Assessment for Learning: Putting It into Practice, , Open University Press, Buckingham; Bloom, B., The 2 sigma problem: the search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring (1984) Educational Researcher, 13 (6), pp. 4-16; Cain, K., Oakhill, J., Inference making ability and its relation to comprehension failure in young children (1999) Reading and Writing, 11 (5-6), pp. 489-503; (2016) Note d’actualité, , www.cnesco.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/161206_Note_PISA.pdf, (accessed: 2 May 2018; Cohen, J., A power primer (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112 (1), pp. 155-159; Colmant, M., Le Cam, M., (2016) PIRLS 2016 etude internationale des CM1 en compréhension de l’Ecrit – evolution des performances sur quinze ans, , Note d’information n°17.24, décembre 2017; Coomey, M., Stephenson, J., Online learning: it is all about dialogue, involvement, support and control – according to the research (2001) Teaching and Learning Online: pedagogies for New Technologies, , Stephenson, J.

All this time, in the face-to-face method of learning process, students have not been able to optimize the mastery of knowledge and skills as expected. One of the things that the Information Systems Study Program did to optimize said mastery is applying the blended learning program in e-Procurement courses. This study uses mixed method evaluation approach in evaluating various stages of the process to implement a blended learning program. Meanwhile, the evaluation method used consists of 2 parts of the model namely 1) CIPP, an evaluation carried out on context, input, process, and product, 2) The Flashlight Triad, an evaluation of activities that utilize information technology online. As the final result of evaluating the implementation of blended learning based on observations and research that has been done, there is an optimization of the increase in mastery of students' knowledge and skills, after conducting various activities that are conditioned on face-to-face activities combined with online ones. The results of this evaluation mean that a well-conditioned blended learning program can influence students in terms of motivation, therefore mastering the knowledge and skills of a course can be optimized through the student learning experience. © 2018 Authors.","Blended learning; Conditioned; Evaluation of mastery; Knowledge; Learning process; Skills",,"Zuppo, C.M., Defining ICT in a boundaryless world: The development of a working hierarchy (2012) International Journal of Managing Information Technology, 4 (3), pp. 13-22; Heyvaert, M., Hannes, K., Maes, B., Onghena, P., Critical appraisal of mixed methods studies (2013) Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 7 (4), pp. 302-327; Tshabalala, M., Ndeya-Ndereya, C., van der Merwe, T., Implementing blended learning at a developing university: Obstacles in the way (2014) Electronic Journal of E-learning, 12 (1), pp. 101-110; Maarop, A.H., Embi, M.A., Implementation of blended learning in higher learning institutions: A review of literature (2016) International Education Studies, 9 (3), pp. 41-52; Singh, H., Building effective blended learning programs (2003) Educational Technology, 43 (6), pp. 51-54; Day, J.

There is a close link between learning outcomes and students' motivation to learn. Thus, the success of blended learning in Saudi higher education depends on not only using different teaching methods and massive expenditures on technology but also on students' motivation to learn. The main objective of this study is to measure the effect of using the Web 2.0 technology on students' motivation to learn in a blended learning environment through their attention, relevance, confidence, satisfaction inside in this environment. This study used a randomized experimental research design to examine differences in student's motivation based on their use of Web 2.0 tools in a blended environment in the Computer Science at Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU). This study adopted Keller's ARCS model of motivation to develop a comprehensive framework of factors that affect the use of Web 2.0 tools in blended learning environment. A questionnaire was conducted to collect data from students. Throughout our investigation, we found that there was a statistically significant difference at the level of 0.05 in overall student motivation between the experimental and control groups resulting from the using Web 2.0 tools technology. Moreover, students using Web 2.0 tools were found to exhibit a statistically significant higher degree of motivation. The results of this study can help decision makers readjust the learning strategy by realizing the importance of using Web 2.0 tools as the main platform in Saudi higher education. © 2018, (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.","ARCS model; Blended learning; Motivation; Web2.0 tools",,"(2008) 'Evaluating Online Learning: Challenges and Strategies for Success', , Washington, D.C.: Education Publications Center; Clement, C., Jones, K., 'Blended Learning vs. Traditional Classroom Settings: Assessing Effectiveness and Student Perceptions in an MBA Accounting Course' (2007) Journal of Educators Online, 4 (1), pp. 1-15; Lave, J., Wenger, E., (1991) Situated learning, , Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press; Abram, S., 'Web 2.0, Library 2.0, and Librarian 2.0: Preparing for the 2.0 World' (2007) Library and Information Services in Astronomy, 377, pp. 161-167; Confrey, J., (1995) 'How Compatible are Radical Constructivism, Sociocultural Approaches, and Social Constructivism?' in Constructivism in Education, , Steffe LP and Gale,J Ed., ),Hover: UK; Graham, R., 'Blended learning systems: Definition, current trends, and future directions,' (2006) In The Handbook of Blended Learning: Global Perspectives, pp. 1-32. , Local Designs.

To date there has been little effort to address this need for a validated, appropriate, and simple-to-execute method that will facilitate such an audit, whether it be at the scale of an individual program, department, faculty, or institution. The data are of increasing value to ensure institutions maintain progress and equity in the student experience as well as for deployment and interpretation of learning analytics. This study presents a generalizable framework for auditing digital learning provision in higher education curricula. The framework is contextualized using a case study in which the audit is conducted across a single faculty in a research-intensive UK university.

One popular application of analytics is Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems. Such systems can be used in a formative way; for example, by providing students with feedback on digitally submitted assignments. This paper presents work on the development of an AWE software tool for an Australian university using advanced text analytics techniques. The tool was designed to provide students with timely feedback on their initial assignment drafts, for revision and further improvement. Moreover, it could also assist academics in better understanding students' assignment performance so as to inform future teaching activities. The paper provides details on the methodology used for development of the software, and presents the results obtained from the analysis of text-based assignments submitted in two subjects. The results are discussed, highlighting how the tool can provide practical value, followed by insights into existing challenges and possible future directions. © 2017 Nathawitharana, Huang, Ong, Vitartas, Jayaratne, Alahakoon, Midford, Michalewicz, Sullivan Mort, Ahmed.","Assignment feedback; Automated writing evaluation; Learning analytics; Text analysis",,"(2010) LAK '11: 1st International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge 2011, , https://tekri.athabascau.ca/analytics/; Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., (2009) Natural language processing with Python, , analyzing text with the natural language toolkit: O'Reilly Media, Inc; Blei, D.M., Jordan, M.I., Griffiths, T.L., Tenenbaum, J.B., Hierarchical topic models and the nested chinese restaurant process (2003) Paper presented at the Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, , Whistler, British Columbia, Canada; Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., Jordan, M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation (2003) Journal of machine learning research, 3, pp. 993-1022. , http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v3/, Jan; Chowdhury, G.G., Natural language processing (2003) Annual review of information science and technology, 37 (1), pp. 51-89; Coh-Metrix, , http://cohmetrix.com/; Dawson, P., Assessment rubrics: towards clearer and more replicable design, research and practice (2017) Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 42 (3), pp. 347-360; Deane, P., On the relation between automated essay scoring and modern views of the writing construct (2013) Assessing Writing, 18 (1), pp. 7-24; (2017) International Educational Data Mining Society website, , http://www.educationaldatamining.org/; (2017) Kibana, , https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana; (2017) Criterion®, , https://www.ets.org/criterion; (2017) TOEFL: For Academic Institutions: Scores, , https://www.ets.org/toefl/institutions/scores; Flesch, R., A new readability yardstick (1948) Journal of applied psychology, 32 (3), pp. 221-233; Frantzi, K., Ananiadou, S., Mima, H., Automatic recognition of multi-word terms:. the C-value/NC-value method (2000) International Journal on Digital Libraries, 3 (2), pp. 115-130; Kincaid, J.P., Fishburne, R.P., Jr., Rogers, R.L., Chissom, B.S., (1975) Derivation of new readability formulas (automated readability index, fog count and flesch reading ease formula) for navy enlisted personnel (No. RBR-8-75), , http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA006655, Retrieved from Defense Technical Information Center website; (2017) LanguageTool Style and Grammar Check, , https://www.languagetool.org/; Li, W., McCallum, A., Pachinko allocation: DAG-structured mixture models of topic correlations (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Machine learning, pp. 577-584; Liddy, E.D., Natural language processing (2001) Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, pp. 2126-2136. , M.

Hence, the purpose of this study is to validate a scale used to evaluate the degree to which the students perceive the five aspects of instructional design: objectives, curricular content, learning activities, educational resources, and the existing evaluation strategy at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC). Through the use of an analytical and descriptive study, as well as qualitative and quantitative techniques, a Likert evaluation scale was designed. According to the results, the final version of the instrument consisted of 33 items and had a confidence coefficient of 0.923. In regards to the evidence associated to its validity, it was possible to verify the representability and relevance of the instructional design components and their factorial structure. The main conclusion obtained from this study is the importance of measuring, from a systemic perspective, the instructional design components, in classroom, blended learning and virtual courses with tools that are properly validated in order to guarantee the confidence level and valid interpretation of the results. © 2016, The Author(s).","Higher education; Instructional design; Learning environments; Validation",,"Arjona, M., Blando, M., (2007) Diseño Instruccional, elemento clave en el desarrollo de cursos para Ambientes Virtuales de Aprendizaje, , http://bibliotecadigital.conevyt.org.mx/colecciones/documentos/somece/51.pdf; Bates, T., Sangrà, A., (2011) Managing technology in higher education: Strategies for transforming teaching and learning, , John Wiley & Sons, San Francisco; Berger, C., Kam, R., (1996) Education 626: Educational Software Design and Authoring, , http://www.umich.edu/~ed626/define.html; Bernard, R.M., Abrami, P.C., Lou, Y., Borokhovski, E., Wade, A., Wozney, L., Fiset, M., Huang, B., How does distance education compare to classroom instruction?

The model development is based on survey data collected from representative teachers and students studying in higher education institutions in Turkey. To develop the model, the study investigated the attitudes of the representative key stakeholders in the relevant higher education institutions towards e-learning by administrating questionnaires and interviews with teachers and students. The responses of the teachers and students were then compared. Based on the results, a model was proposed with a multidimensional approach to e-learning. The model ips electrical engineering to make sure that the students review, discuss, and explore course content before and after class. The proposed model encourages students to start with e-learning, to continue with the face-to-face learning setting on campus, and then to come back to e- learning for evaluating their learning in the classroom. Using this model, students can study at home and assess their learning before and after their attendance to campus lectures and enhance their learning with various types of learning, namely self-directed learning, self-assessment, teacher-directed learning, teacher assessment, computer-directed learning, and computer assessment. Similarly, model evaluation was conducted at the relevant higher education institutions. To evaluate the applicability of the model, a case-control study was conducted to determine whether the model had the intended effect on the participating students of the relevant institutions. As a result of the case-control study, the effects of e-learning, blended learning, and traditional learning were verified by teaching the use of MATLAB software.

The purpose of this cooperation was conceived from an organisational desire to establish a virtual learning environment (VLE), where it was possible, to build activities and underpin the pedagogical approach. Another perspective was to further improve the communication between the administration, teachers and students. This paper will highlight the development process and some of the didactic considerations undertaken for the implementation. The evaluations undertaken during the process will also be presented, along with the results collected in the use of Moodle to highlight the educational changes. © 2016, IGI Global.","Blended Learning; Learning Activities; Learning Practice; Moodle Platform; Problem Based Learning; Virtual Learning Environments",,"Attwell, G., Personal learning environments-The future of elearning?

The interpretive work draws on four action research cycles conducted over two years with two student cohorts. Discussion is based on observations, staff and student focus groups and interviews examining the students’ expectations and experiences. The initial focus of the action research was on the introduction of technology into the teaching and learning experience. However, the advantage of an interpretive approach is allowing the findings to determine the course of the research. During the first action research cycles, the focus of the research changed from the use of technology in blended learning to the role of the practitioners involved. The authors advocate the key role of reflective practitioners in facilitating blended learning and suggest that action research is a useful framework. © 2010, IGI Global.

The open collaborative platform focused on the nature of the Web 2.0 era which is using associated tool for education technology, participation of students, and interactive approach. Higher education institution is challenged to become more creative to create an interactive learning platform. One of the trending solutions is used social learning platform, which combines learning technology with the social me- dia environment. Social learning as learning method combines multiple media that are designed to complement the learning platform. The purpose of this study is to identify how social media could implement as an interactive tool to support blended learning in a higher education institution. The methodology of this study using design science re- search to identify the appropriate social learning system model which consists of seven stages: design as an artifact, problem relevance, design evaluation, research contribution, research rigor, design as a search process, and communication of research. The result of this study provides a social learning systems application as a tool for higher education institutions to increase learning experience in terms of participation and collaborative learning.

In the master course Agile Software Architectures it was decided to use the Blended Learning modality. It is relevant, therefore, to know the students’ perception of this modality, not only while taking the course but after having seen it. This article analyzes the students’ perception of the Agile Software Architectures course taught at University de los Andes. The perception of the students was measured through an anonymous survey of the students who were enrolled in the course for the periods 2015-2018. The results showed that 39.7% of the respondents considered that they learned better compared to face-to-face courses. Additionally, the most valued aspect by respondents was the use of industry problems. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

The online material mainly consists of video tutorials, other open source web tools and multi-choice self-assessment exercises. During the academic year 2016-2017, the e-Learning course was not available yet, but then the online course was first implemented (2017/18) and fully adopted (2018/2019).The online tutoring support was activated alongside a traditional general chemistry course, adopting a blended mode, with the aims of: (i) homogenizing freshmen’s chemistry knowledge; (ii) fostering the most appropriate method of study in a multi access modality; (iii) implementing the Johnstone’s three levels’ knowledge and (iv) increasing students’ self-confidence, by the means of a self-evaluation training process. Differently from previous studies, the online course herein aimed mainly to develop a correct method of study of chemistry topics, with a punctual description of what-and-how to do. The results, i.e. the exam's scores, the time spent in the platform, and the successful percentage of students per year, have been collected and analysed through qualitative and quantitative methods. Apart a general satisfaction of the students perceived by the answers to a survey questionnaire, the analysis of the data shows an increase of 11 % of students passing the final exam within three exam sessions together with an improvement and a positive correlation between the time spent on the platform and the mid-term scores achieved. © Italian e-Learning Association.","Blended Learning; Chemistry Education; ICT; Moodle; Tutorial Online",,"Abrahim, S., Mir, B.A., Suhara, H., Mohamed, F.A., Sato, M., Structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis of social media use and education (2019) International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 16 (1); Bell, P., Volckmann, D., Knowledge surveys in general chemistry: Confidence, overconfidence, and performance (2011) J.

The purpose of this mixed methods study was two-fold. The first purpose was to investigate pedagogical changes that occurred as a result of the professional development that included a year-long faculty learning community by exploring influences on pedagogical changes. The second purpose was to understand the perceptions of the diffusion of innovations (DOI) characteristics that influenced the level of adoption of online/blended teaching by faculty participants. A survey was used to measure the perceived characters of innovation as defined in the theoretical framework. Following the survey, one-on-one interviews that were linked to the DOI theoretical framework were conducted to better understand those characteristics. The results presented herein focus on barriers, challenges, and successes of adopting e-learning pedagogy in these online and blended learning environments. © 2020, The Online Learning Consortium.

However, recent literature has revealed that developing countries' educational institutions fail when they adopt LMS technologies because they ignore the human factors related to these technologies. This study investigated the impact of human factors on the effectiveness of LMS in a blended learning environment at Kuwait's HEIs (KHEIs). In this paper, a pragmatic approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods is used. User characteristics traits from the literature review were organized into three main indicators of human impact on the effectiveness of LMS: technological characteristics, psychological characteristics, and student-instructor interaction characteristics. After these indicators were identified, a conceptual model was developed to study the characteristics. A deductive approach was used, and the model was tested for significance through receiving feedback from the universities' students and faculty members. In addition, an inductive approach was implemented through conducting interviews to explore more factors related to the effectiveness of LMS. The inductive approach's results revealed the relevant factors for the usage of the LMS, such as training, needs, expectations, and branding. The human factors that positively affect the success and effectiveness of LMS included attitude, enjoyment, experience, self-efficacy, and promptness, which had the most substantial impacts on user satisfaction. The modified conceptual model that this paper presents includes these impacting factors and provides an acceptable fit to the data. This research has developed an updated framework for demonstrating the effectiveness of LMS as it pertains to human factors, and its findings can be used to enhance user experience in a blended learning environment, thus improving the quality of Kuwaiti education. © 2013 IEEE.","blended learning; effectiveness of LMS; human factors; Kuwait's higher education institutions; Learning management systems (LMSs)","Computer aided instruction; Developing countries; Education computing; Human engineering; Students; User experience; Blended learning; effectiveness of LMS; Higher education institutions; Learning management system; Psychological characteristics; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Student-instructor interactions; Technological characteristics; Learning systems","Nikoli, V., Petkovi, D., Deni, N., Milovanevi, M., Gavrilovi, S., Appraisal and review of e-learning and ICT systems in teaching process (2019) Phys.

In spite of problems related to ICT hardware and software, limited instructional materials, resistance to organizational change, issues on how to make course content more engaging, and issues on effective learning pedagogy, the result of the study revealed that the e-learning platform satisfactorily complied with the usability issues and students were satisfied in using the platform as support to learning. Also, the test of the gain score (posttest-pretest) indicates a significant difference between the two treatment groups which reveals that increasing the academic performance of the students through the e-learning is an important factor. Furthermore, the proposed e-Learning platform is a timely contribution to improve and support the academic practices of both teaching and learning practices at the University. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This transformation comes in the wake of the end consumer of technical institutions: the industry, wanting a more creative, innovative, thinking, strongly communicative workforce. Therefore, looking for a more individualistic, change-oriented and opinionated individual. The age old method of lecture or face to face interaction does not become irrelevant but needs to be in semblance with the present environment of learning and teaching. In today’s world technology has a definitive part in the lives of students be it in the classroom or outside therefore the teaching plans need to have technology and learners need to be adept in them for technology based skill is a valid and mandatory industry skill (Pearson & Thomas, 2002). In coming years as learners and the faculty are going to use and create a semblance of technology it is bound to grow more in the classroom as learning tools. (Dahlstrom, Walker, & Dziuban, 2013).

The quantitative information was collected with an ad hoc questionnaire to which 980 university teachers replied; of these, 86 openly expressed their opinion about these methodologies. In order to integrate the results of the QUANT-QUAL analysis, a SWOT analysis was carried out in which university teachers expressed the weaknesses, threats, strengths and opportunities of Blended Learning at universities-at both an internal and external level. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

These changes pose fresh challenges to the prevalent education systems all over the world, which already have fallen short of the expectations. The purpose of this study is to show that e-learning is not only about ICT following a holistic approach to learning which embeds systemic approach and learning loops but also about students and teacher’s actions in ICT-enabled learning environment. This study investigates the importance of engagement of students and teachers in blended learning with a focus on factors which affect this engagement. Design/methodology/approach: Based on systems theory and socio-technological approach to e-learning, the paper documents an experiment which was carried out in a higher education institution. Postgraduate students of one course were divided into two groups. Instructor of the first group was not required to engage with the online content and had to deliver his course in a traditional face-to-face format. Instructor of the second group continuously spent time on the learning management system (LMS), developing more content, participating in online discussions and responding to students. LMS tracked the online activity of both the instructors, and semi-structured interviews of students were conducted. Findings: Based on behaviour of 152 students of a postgraduate programme, students’ time spent online is directly proportional to the instructor’s online time, promptness of instructor’s response to online activities queries of students increased student engagement, the students’ engagement increases if the online content is related to the syllabus but engagement is not the same as the face-to-face lectures in the class. Research limitations/implications: The research was conducted in India and is based on the behaviour of instructors and students in India. It was focussed on engagement issues of blended learning, while other issues of blended learning have not been in the focus of the research. Practical implications: The research is important for the practice of higher education, and the result of the study can be taken into consideration while developing online courses for students enrolled in higher education. Social implications: If higher education institutions take a strategic decision to use ICT in e-learning, engagements of participants and factors affecting engagement are crucial for the better quality of education. In such a way, blended learning fulfils requirements of a holistic approach to learning. Originality/value: Despite the fact that e-learning as a way to deliver academic content has been extensively researched, there are not many studies focussed on engagement issues in blended learning, and even fewer studies have been conducted in an experimental way which allow in-depth research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; E-learning; Experimental research; Students’ engagement; Systems theory; Teachers’ engagement","Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Information use; Students; System theory; Teaching; Blended learning; Design/methodology/approach; Experimental research; Higher education institutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning management system; Postgraduate students; Semi structured interviews; E-learning","(2019) Free online course on swayam by faculties and universities from, , https://swayam.gov.in/About, (accessed: 9 January 2019; Anderson, A., Huttenlocher, D., Kleinberg, J., Leskovec, J., (2014) Engaging with massive online courses, , www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/www14-courses.pdf, (accessed: 11 April 2018; (2010) Annual status of education report (rural) 2009, , http://img.asercentre.org/docs/Publications/ASER%20Reports/ASER_2009/Aser2009ReportFull.pdf, (accessed: 8 February 2018; Barnett, E.A., Validation experiences and persistence among community college students (2011) The Review of Higher Education, 34 (2), pp. 193-230; Blazun, H., Bobek, S., Sternad Zabukovšek, S., Kokol, P., Openness and information technology: a bibliometric analysis of literature production (2017) Kybernetes, 46 (5), pp. 750-766; Blazun, H., Kokol, P., Bobek, S., Železnik, D., Završnik, J., A bibliometric retrospective of the journal computers in human behavior (1991-2015) (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 65, pp. 46-58; Carini, R.M., Kuh, G.D., Klein, S.P., Student engagement and student learning: testing the linkages (2006) Research in Higher Education, 47 (1), pp. 1-32; Chen, K.-C., Jang, S.-J., Motivation in online learning: testing a model of self-determination theory (2010) Computers in Human Behavior, 26 (4), pp. 741-752. , https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CHB.2010.01.011; Czerniewicz, L., Deacon, A., Small, J., Walji, S., Developing world MOOCs: a curriculum view of the MOOC landscape (2014) Journal of Global Literacies, Technologies, and Emerging Pedagogies, 2 (3), pp. 122-139; Drossos, L., Vassiliadis, B., Stefani, A., Xenos, M., Sakkopoulos, E., Tsakalidis, A., Introducing ICT in traditional higher education environment: background, design and evaluation of a blended approach (2006) International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education, 2 (1), pp. 65-78; Dziuban, C., Moskal, P., (2011) A course is a course is a course: factor invariance in student evaluation of online, blended and face-to-face learning environments, , www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751611000388, The Internet and Higher Education; Fassinger, R., Morrow, S.L., Toward best practices in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed- method resea…: at UPES LIBRARY (2013) Journal for Social Action in Counseling and Psychology, 5 (2), pp. 69-83. , http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=40a3f896-b989-41b4-bf45-16771ecefe37%40sessionmgr4008&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3D#AN=93598272&db=asx; (2012) FICCI higher education summit 2012: higher education in India: twelfth five year and beyond, , http://ficci.in/sedocument/20244/recommendations-2012.pdf, (accessed, 11 April 2018; Friedman, T., Come the revolution (2012) New York Times, 5 (12); Galvis, Á.H., Supporting decision-making processes on blended learning in higher education: literature and good practices review (2018) International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 15 (1), p. 25. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-018-0106-1; Garrison, D.R., Kanuka, H., Blended learning: nncovering its transformative potential in higher education (2004) The Internet and Higher Education, 7 (2), pp. 95-105; Garrison, D.R., Anderson, T., Archer, W., Critical thinking, cognitive presence, and computer conferencing in distance education (2001) American Journal of Distance Education, 15 (1), pp. 7-23. , https://doi.org/10.1080/08923640109527071; (2019) Weblet importer, , http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/9th/vol2/v2c3-3.htm, (accessed: 9 January 2019; Graham, C.R., Emerging practice and research in blended learning (2013) Handbook of Distance Education, pp. 333-350. , Moore, M.G.

In that sense, this study investigates the perceptual assessments that students have about the characteristics of the RSU in a public university in southern Peru. Following a quantitative approach, information was collected from 326 students from different academic areas, through the Evaluation Questionnaire. The results showed the high reliability of the instrument. Additionally, the favorable perception of the characteristics of the RSU implemented in the university was recognized, which resulted in a high commitment to social change in the direction proposed by (Retolaza, 2010). In the same way, they found that these results do not show differences in the favorable perception to the characteristics of the RSU, we conclude that these aspects are irrelevant in the assessment made by the students. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

The course was (re)imagined to meet the needs of students who will be preservice and future teachers. Course design for the (re)imagined course was based on 1) current literature related to TPACK, ISTE Standards and current issues in classroom technology integration and 2) a design framework including ADDIE principles and blended learning. The study was conducted during Spring 2018 in a face-to-face (F2) version of the ITT course at a Southwestern university in the US. Evaluation and feedback were collected from twenty-two students who completed the course. In addition to providing study findings, the article concludes with recommendations for the next course iteration and faculty members interested in (re)imagining learning technology courses. © 2018, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.","ADDIE; Blended learning; Educational technology; Learning design; Preservice teachers; TPACK",,"Baran, E., Chuang, H.H., Thompson, A., TPACK: An emerging research and development tool for teacher educators (2011) Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology-TOJET, 10 (4), pp. 370-377; Brenner, A.M., Brill, J.M., Investigating practices in teacher education that promote and inhibit technology integration transfer in early career teachers (2016) TechTrends, 60 (2), pp. 136-144; Chai, C.S., Koh, J.H.L., Tsai, C.-C., Facilitating preservice teachers' development of technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) (2010) Educational Technology & Society, 13 (4), pp. 63-73; Deterding, S., Dixon, D., Khaled, R., Nacke, L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining gamification (2011) In Proceedings of the 15Th International Academic Mindtrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, pp. 9-15. , ACM; Foulger, T.S., Graziano, K.J., Schmidt-Crawford, D., Slykhuis, D.A., Teacher educator technology competencies (2017) Journal of Technology and Teacher Education, 25 (4), pp. 413-448; Freire, P., (2009) Teachers as Cultural Workers: Letters to Those Who Dare Teach with New Commentary, , Peter McLaren, Joe L.

This research aims to investigate the impact of using the Edmodo net-work among the students at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University and stu-dents' attitudes toward it. Background The creators of e-learning systems have recently taken remarkable strides, in-cluding the development of a full range of techniques and means of communi-cation. Social networks encourage collaborative work and thus have huge poten-tial to increase information sharing among users, which makes these networks especially useful in academic and higher-education systems. Edmodo network is one of the main choices to be adopted in education process. Methodology This research has an experimental design based on a set of online tests. It also includes the development of a scale to determine students' attitudes toward Edmodo Contribution There is a lack of studies on the adoption of Edmodo within higher education. This research is an investigation of the impact that using Edmodo had on stu-dents at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University. Findings The findings of this research show that using Edmodo leads to a statistically significant improvement in learning skills among higher-education students. The results also illustrate that students have positive attitudes toward the use of Edmodo in their courses. Recommendations for Practitioners Adopting Edmodo within their teaching model. Recommendations for Researchers More investigation on this topic with a larger number of participants is recom-mended Impact on Society This investigation provides society with better understanding of adopting Ed-modo within higher education. Future Research Further work should include investigations of this topic that include a larger number of participants with more diverse backgrounds. The challenges of us-ing Edmodo also need to be investigated in further studies. © 2019.","Academic social media; Blended learning; E-learning networks; Edmodo",,"Abdumahdy, A., (2011) University students' attitudes in Jordan using Blackboard software in their learning, , College of Educational Sciences, University of Jordan; Al-Essa, N.S., The impact of using Edmodo as a blended learning medium on promoting Saudi EFL female secondary school students' English grammar (2018) Arab World English Journal, 221, pp. 1-112. , https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.221; Al-Hathifi, K., The effectiveness of the problem-based education strategy in the development of academic achievement and the attitudes toward science among middle school students (2003) Journal of Studies in Curricula and Teaching Methods; AlKhalidi, H., The role of local and global computer networks in promoting cooperative learning (2007) Journal of Arabic Education Future, 46, p. 95; Al-Omri, K., Sultan Qaboos students' attitudes toward psychology (2004) Journal of Educational Sciences, , Sultan Qaboos University; Bell, J., (2014) Doingyour research project: A guide for first-time researchers, , McGraw-Hill Education (UK); Blake, C.S., A procedure for the initial evaluation and analysis of linear programmes (1966) Aspects of educational technology, , J.

The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is a measure of teachers pedagogical, content and technical knowledge and their skill to embed technology in practice. Using the TPACK framework, this study explores the relationship between technical skills, learning design and how these relate to pedagogy. The study also investigates how TPACK varies by subject area, teaching qualification, and employment. A survey of 112 lecturers from a multi-campus university was conducted. We found that lecturers who have high TPACK tend to use more varied and interactive learning activities. TPACK did not significantly vary by subject area. It did not also vary between those who received a few trainings over the past year in comparison to those who didn’t. However, significant differences in TPACK were found in terms of nature of employment and teaching qualification in higher education. These findings suggest that there is a need to provide a varied approach to develop staff competencies. © 2019 K.

The programming courses are taught by applying a traditional learning method in which the programming concepts are explained theoretically and minimal practical work is applied. In addition, students receive either no formative feedback or minimal manual delayed feedback after submitting their practical work. This negatively affects students' performance as students find it difficult to understand the programming concepts. This paper addresses the aforementioned drawbacks by applying blended learning for the first time to the C programming course which is taught to more than 1000 students each year at An-Najah National University, Palestine. Blended learning is a hybrid learning method which integrates the traditional learning method with technology and online learning. It provides students with more practical work and automated immediate formative feedback. This paper aims to study the effect of blended learning on students' performance, and students' satisfaction with the blended learning method. An independent experimental design was applied on 1374 undergraduate students enrolled in C programming course. Students were divided into two groups based on the learning method. The first group consisted of 632 students who studied the course using the traditional learning method, while the second group consisted of 742 students in which blended learning was applied. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were applied and the results revealed that blended learning improved student performance significantly compared with traditional learning. In addition, the results revealed that students were satisfied with the blended learning method in terms of easiness to use and suitability for programming and submitting assignments. © 2013 IEEE.","Automatic evaluation; blended learning; e-learning; formative feedback; performance; traditional learning method; Virtual Programming Lab (VPL)","C (programming language); Curricula; E-learning; Students; Automatic evaluation; Blended learning; Formative feedbacks; performance; Traditional learning; Virtual programming; Learning systems","Holsapple, C.W., Lee-Post, A., Defining, assessing, and promoting e-learning success: An information systems perspective (2006) Decis.

The research was aimed at introducing a better and a qualitative teaching and learning approach which can accommodate the overpopulated classes in African institutions. A mixed research method was implemented in gathering and analyzing the data obtained from the study. A mixed learning experiment was conducted with some students from an African higher institution. One hundred and twenty-five students taking a JAVA programming course participated in the experiment. Focus team, semi-structured interview, and questionnaires were employed during the experiment. The findings argue that the new learning approach (blended learning) may motivate and enhance the students’ learning efficiency. In conclusion, a framework or a guideline has been suggested for the possible implementation of blended learning in African higher education institutions amidst their limited resources, and educational institutions in developing countries at large. © J.UCS.","African institutions; Approach to learning; Blended learning; Face-to-face learning; Students’ perception",,"Adeyeye, M.O., Musa, A.G., Botha, A., Problem with multi-video format m-learning applications E-Learning, 2, pp. 294-330. , Adeyeye, 13, J.-E.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the technological and teaching methodologies as well as the unique advantages and challenges of collaboration between four partner institutions on two continents as well as local industry partners and local and international academic and public libraries, in offering a blended learning program to students from six different countries. Design/methodology/approach: The contribution is based on a pragmatic and reflective analysis of the success of the strategic partnerships formed during the M.IT program. The data-gathering instrument used was a questionnaire containing open-ended questions. Findings: Analysis of the comments shows that it is evident that faculty still prefer face-to-face classes. Furthermore, to experience an effective online blended learning, the technology would have to improve. The complicated levels of partnerships were important to provide the necessary expertise for this broad-based program. Lecturers from industries and libraries brought different perspectives based on their day-to-day work and practical experience and, through this, a level of reality as opposed to the theory that can be learnt from textbooks. Originality/value: This is a descriptive analysis of the program and feedback of co-workers that has not been reported before. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blended learning; Information technology;

The research compares perceptions of students who have been subjected to online education along with those who have not been exposed to online education and examines likelihood to take online courses. Design/methodology/approach: Paper and pencil surveys were distributed in different classes in business classes at a university in southwest USA. The target group was undergraduate students. Findings: The results indicate that overall, students have neutral perceptions about online courses, while favorable perceptions are strongly associated with likelihood to take online courses. Moreover, prior exposure with online courses is not a significant factor in forming favorable perceptions about online courses. Research limitations/implications: The present research is limited in generalizability and the institution surveyed in the southwest region is new to online courses offering in their curriculum and not all the participants had prior experience with online courses. Originality/value: Although this paper compares online education with traditional, another option for methods of education include hybrid models incorporating both. A possible third option not discussed through this research is a hybrid or blended learning course, a combination of both online and traditional courses. This opens the options for the student, as hybrid courses can be built with many different options. One includes using technology for “screencasts” or lectures online. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Online education; Technology",,"Aithal, P.S., Aithal, S., Impact of on-line education on higher education system (2016) International Journal of Engineering Research and Modern Education, 1, pp. 225-235; Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2011) Going the Distance: Online Education in the United States, , Sloan Consortium, Newburyport, MA; Allen, I.E., Seaman, J., (2013) Changing Course: Ten Years of Tracking Online Education in the United States, , Sloan Consortium, Newburyport, MA; Armstrong, D.A., Students’ perceptions of online learning and instructional tools: a qualitative study of undergraduate students use of online tools (2011) Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology, 10 (3), pp. 222-226; Auster, C.J., Blended learning as a potentially winning combination of face-to-face and online learning: an exploratory study (2016) Teaching Sociology, 44 (1), pp. 39-48; Can, G., A comparative study on student perceptions of face-to-face learning and online learning (2007) 6th WSEAS International Conference on Education and Educational Technology, , Venice: November 21-23; Conceição, S.O., Competing in the world’s global education and technology arenas (2016) New Directions for Adult & Continuing Education, 2016 (149), pp. 53-61; Estelami, H., An exploratory study of the effects of online course efficiency perceptions on student evaluation of teaching (SET) measures (2016) American Journal of Business Education, 9 (2), pp. 67-82; Gok, T., The evaluations of the college students’ perceptions on distance education from the point of the technical and educational factors (2015) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 16 (2), pp. 84-93; Iwuchukwu, O., The perception of English literature students on examination and online (web-based) learning (2014) Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education, 15 (1), pp. 152-165; Kuzma, A., Kuzma, J., Thiewes, H., Business student attitudes, experience, and satisfaction with online courses (2015) American Journal of Business Education, 8 (2), pp. 121-310; Lim, D.H., Morris, M.L., Kupritz, V.W., Online vs blended learning: differences in instructional outcomes and learner satisfaction (2007) Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 11 (2), pp. 27-42; Lippel, P.H., Sarma, S.E., Willcox, K.E., (2016) Online education: a catalyst for higher education reforms report, , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA; Mollenkopf, D., Vu, P., Crow, S., Black, C., Does online learning deliver?

The project benefited from central university funding to support 19 departments, faculties and other academic units to fast-track the development and improvement of their WebLearn presence in order to enhance the student learning experience. This was the first time in the Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) team that formal usability testing had been carried out on the VLE used by staff and students for both full distance and blended learning study programmes. The WISE team members devised a methodology to assess certain usability criteria that would be helpful in the context of the project. The methodology included various techniques generally used in usability testing such as first-click testing, scenarios, focus group discussion and memory tasks.

In this context, the use of new educative technologies is stimulated at the Faculty of Medicine of Eduardo Mondlane University (FMUEM) in Mozambique. The Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto (FMUP) and FMUEM have a long-lasting record of collaborative work. Within this framework, both institutions embarked in a partnership, aimed to develop a blended learning course of pathology for undergraduates, shared between the two faculties and incorporating interactive digital microscopy as a central learning tool. Methods: A core team of faculty members from both institutions identified the existing resources and previous experiences in the two faculties. The Moodle course for students from the University of Porto was the basis to implement the current project. The objective was to develop educational modules of mutual interest, designed for e-learning, followed by a voluntary student's survey conducted in FMUEM to get their perception about the process. Results: We selected contents from the pathology curricula of FMUP and FMUEM that were of mutual interest. We next identified and produced new contents for the shared curricula. The implementation involved joint collaboration and training to prepare the new contents, together with building quizzes for self-evaluation. All the practical sessions were based on the use of interactive digital microscopy. The students have reacted enthusiastically to the incorporation of the online component that increased their performance and motivation for pathology learning. For the students in Porto, the major acquisition was the access to slides from infectious diseases as well as autopsy videos. Conclusions: Our study indicates that students benefited from high-quality educational contents, with emphasis on digital microscopy, in a platform generated in a win-win situation for FMUP and FMUEM. © 2018 Journal of Pathology Informatics.","B-learning; Digital microscopy; Medical education; Pathology",,"(2004) Curricula of the Medical Doctor Course, , http://www.medicina.uem.mz/images/curriculo_medicina_UEM.pdf, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University.

How educators are prepared to teach potentially impacts the quality of instruction provided in blended and online learning courses. Teaching presence is essential to achieving student learning outcomes, yet previous research has focused on student perceptions of teaching presence. Therefore, the purpose of this mixed methods convergent parallel study was to explore educators’ preparation to teach, perceived teaching presence, and perceived teaching presence behaviors in blended and online learning environments. The study was designed to examine the differences in educators’ perceived teaching presence and preparation to teach in blended and online learning environments. An adapted Community of Inquiry survey instrument was used to measure faculty perceptions of teaching presence. Results indicated a statistically significant difference between perceived teaching presence of facilitation for faculty that completed certification courses in preparation to teach in blended and online learning environments, as compared to faculty that only received on-the-job training. Qualitative responses to corresponding interview questions supported the findings. The findings of this study provide information to university educators and administrators supporting the importance of faculty preparation specific to teaching in blended and online learning environments. © 2018, The Online Learning Consortium.

UTM believes that e-learning is able to increase and enhance opportunities for campus-based students. However, UTM has no intention to conduct solely online learning. As a tertiary institution, UTM aims at becoming a university with online environment and yet maintaining traditional campus-based learning. As teaching a blended course should start with a re-examination of the intended learning outcomes of the course, the teacher needs to design specific online and classroom activities. This research describes the evaluation studies of the computer subject (authoring language) module that was taught in three (3) consecutive semesters. Several blended strategies were suggested and considered as effective interventions to further improve the teacher’s teaching techniques and the students’ learning skills working in a blended mode. The suggestions could also be used as guidelines to plan effective teaching and learning strategies in blended learning. © 2014 American Scientific Publishers.

It has been used in various fields, e.g. education, medicine, architecture, assistance to persons with disabilities, etc. VR leads to the development of new forms of counseling, e.g. via asynchronous learning platform, videoconferencing, social networking, etc. By using the threedimensional virtual immersive learning environments of ""Open Workshop on Information Literacy"" of Patras' University Library, we organized and conducted three educational workshops about career consulting with 50 participants. The Open Workshop is an open and free blended learning initiative for providing flexible training services on academic & professional development to the university's academic community and beyond.

The authors follow the principled task-based curriculum design phases informed by Long and Crookes (1993) and Long and Norris (2000). Unit-based development made the workload manageable and provided an important experimental space for the instructors to best align task-based principles with online language instruction. First, the context of the project and its theoretical TBLT curriculum development framework are established. The distinct processes of needs analysis, materials development, task sequencing and teaching methods, and assessment methods adopted to meet the special requirements of the class are presented, along with a preliminary formative and summative evaluation of the teaching model. The conclusion discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the project.

This process however requires specialized software to be used by a university. The paper tackles issues related with this approach and presents guidelines for construction of a framework for creating web-based education support software in quantitative area - the meta-framework that allows for a rapid construction of web-based educational decision analysis software. The framework design in paper covers three aspect: (1) information system modeling, (2) decision problem modeling and (3) teaching process modeling. The information system modeling includes system architecture, servers, programming languages and technical design. The decision problem modeling provides means to present an abstract decision problem (and more generally - a problem where quantitative methods can be used) and to model interaction between software and decision maker (i.e. a student learning a decision algorithm). Teaching process modeling includes support for linear teaching algorithm in the decision making process, further this can be extended into non-linear and hybrid teaching algorithms. As a proof of concept a working framework prototype named Combine! will be presented. The software's usefulness was evaluated through a survey carried out on 234 students at Warsaw School of Economics. © Tomasz Szapiro, Przemysław Szufel, 2010.","Decision support; Distance education; E-learning; Operations research",,"Bates, T., The promise and myths of e-learning in post-secondary education (2004) The Network Society: A Cross-cultural Perspective, pp. 271-292. , w: M.
