However, most decision support models in location studies of consolidation facilities are limited to numerical computation or multi-criteria analysis while ignoring spatial factors in location selection. This study aims to characterise suitable locations for an inner-city consolidation facility based on spatial aspects, operational requirements, and societal concerns. Accordingly, this study presents an integrated spatial multi-criteria location framework to identify and rank optimal sites for a proposed freight consolidation facility in an inner-city area using 11 decision criteria identified from key stakeholders. Real geographic data from Inner Melbourne, Australia, are used to identify 20 candidate sites which are then evaluated and ranked using the TOPSIS method. The suitability analysis confirms that the most suitable locations are in zones with affordable industrial land with excellent accessibility to major roads and goods receivers. Sensitivity analysis indicates that assigning more significance to the operational requirements and decreasing the priority weight for proximity to residential areas tip favourability towards areas with low real estate costs and more industrially-zoned parts. The multi-criteria spatial modelling allows decision-makers and transport researchers to apply value-decisions at the onset of the process, and it also allows for improved understanding and visualisation of the results and of the significance of the chosen criteria in the evaluation process.

Based on a survey that was conducted among carriers, traffic wardens, and retailers, a decision hierarchy structure, consisting of the relevant criteria evaluated by various statistical techniques, will be used for sustainable implementation of UDCs. The methodology uses a database collected in the historical center of Ouro Preto, a Brazilian city which contains common characteristics of other Latin American and some European cities that are included in theWorld Heritage List. This structure is unique, as it is based on a survey among the main stakeholders, and can be applied by logistics operators and local authorities for implementing UDCs to address urban distribution issues, especially in historical cities. However, without loss of generality, the proposed methodology can be adopted for different cities using the appropriate criteria according to the characteristics of the cities.

The key finding reveals that while UFT policies such as time window restrictions can support successful UCCs, they cannot be considered in isolation from the collaborative UFT policy setting established by the local authority. A successful development also requires a commitment to financially support the UCC over at least the medium term, allowing time for the system to mature and collaborative service offerings to be developed.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating the performance of a parcel distribution network in city logistics. This methodology encompasses the main entities of a two-tier distribution system made up of carriers, huge shopping centers (multi-tenant buildings) and intermediate depots (urban consolidation centers), as well as the parcel flows between them. This methodology aims to optimize the transport flows (distance traveled) of a given distribution network while also quantifying the impact in terms of sustainable development by measuring gas emissions. Two different states of the network with different connectivity degrees are evaluated and compared: the current state of the network as well as its future state. The transport network modeling is based on a network flow, which is expressed in linear programming and implemented with an optimization solver. The validation of this methodology is based on the parcel distribution of the Multi-tenant Buildings of the city of Tokyo. The findings are that the network with greater connectivity between the entities brings significant traveled distance reduction as well as a reduction of emissions of CO2. Another finding is that the grouping of the parcels (i.e., pooling) brings a reduction of the distance traveled compared to the transport organization without grouping and contributes to a reduction in the number of trucks.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating the performance of a parcel distribution network in CITY_LOGISTICS. This methodology encompasses the main entities of a two-tier distribution system made up of CARRIERS, huge shopping centers (MULTI-TENANT_BUILDINGS) and intermediate depots (URBAN_CONSOLIDATION_CENTERs), as well as the parcel flows between them. This methodology aims to optimize the transport flows (distance traveled) of a given distribution network while also quantifying the impact in terms of sustainable development by measuring gas emissions. Two different states of the network with different connectivity degrees are evaluated and compared: the current state of the network as well as its future state. The transport network modeling is based on a network flow, which is expressed in LINEAR_PROGRAMMING and implemented with an optimization solver. The validation of this methodology is based on the parcel distribution of the MULTI-TENANT_BUILDINGS of the city of Tokyo. The findings are that the network with greater connectivity between the entities brings significant traveled distance reduction as well as a reduction of emissions of CO2. Another finding is that the grouping of the parcels (i.e., pooling) brings a reduction of the distance traveled compared to the transport organization without grouping and contributes to a reduction in the number of trucks.

The specificity of such logistics and the multiple limitations led to particular solutions. However, they all share one common feature-the flow consolidation in different variants. This study considers the flow consolidation at the boundary of urban congested areas, through horizontal collaboration between logistic platforms. This way, the urban distribution centers (UDCs) receive all the goods according to the orders addressed to each producer (or group in case of ""on-going consolidations""). Deliveries are addressed to a single logistic platform. Thus, the flow consolidation is achieved. Each logistic platform receives part of the consumer goods intended for commercialization, but through collaboration between them (freight exchanges), all the warehouses of the producers have all the ordered goods. Dedicated management of logistics platforms and warehouses within each UDC ensures the confidentiality of distributor data. Three scenarios are presented concerning the same pattern of flow addressed to each UDC. These scenarios differ by the accessibility of the logistics platforms and by the connection between them (due to infrastructure development). The methodology of choosing the variants for composing the flow sent from each logistics platform considered the minimization of transfer times to UDC warehouses. Synthetic indicators allow for comparison between the analyzed scenarios.

The MAS-ADP based RL is capable of replicating the potential actions of modeled agents in an uncertain environment accurately. The application of MAS-ADP based RL in this research shows that the location of UCC influences the behavior of freight carriers and the UCC operator in the JDS. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a feasibility study of UCC location to support JDS using MAS-ADP based RL to get better evaluation outcomes.

However, since mathematical modeling of multiple site selection often turns out to be NP-hard problem structure, it is not always possible to obtain an optimal solution by the solvers. For this reason, various meta-heuristic approaches have emerged to solve these complex models. In this context, the aim of this study is to propose an integrated methodology which seeks an optimum result efficiently regarding a logistics center location selection problem. Thus, the optimal clustering of logistics mobility in a metropolitan area was carried out with GIS and a meta-heuristic approach. GIS produced the spatial information needed by p-median model, then the meta-heuristic approach determined the optimal result that considers the logistics costs. BPSO algorithm has employed as the meta-heuristic and it is observed that the algorithm can reach the optimum results within superior times for the problem sizes tested where binary integer programming verified the optimums and the algorithm continued to reach improved solutions where the exact algorithms failed for larger instances. The integrated solution methodology is applied to a large metropolitan region and it is found that it can be used properly by the urban city planners and supply chain managers to analyze critical nodes of transportation networks of megacities.

However, since mathematical modeling of multiple site selection often turns out to be NP-hard problem structure, it is not always possible to obtain an optimal solution by the solvers. For this reason, various meta-heuristic approaches have emerged to solve these complex models. In this context, the aim of this study is to propose an integrated methodology which seeks an optimum result efficiently regarding a LOGISTICS center LOCATION_SELECTION problem. Thus, the optimal clustering of LOGISTICS mobility in a metropolitan area was carried out with GIS and a meta-heuristic approach. GIS produced the spatial information needed by p-median model, then the meta-heuristic approach determined the optimal result that considers the LOGISTICS costs. BPSO algorithm has employed as the meta-heuristic and it is observed that the algorithm can reach the optimum results within superior times for the problem sizes tested where binary integer programming verified the optimums and the algorithm continued to reach improved solutions where the exact algorithms failed for larger instances. The integrated solution methodology is applied to a large metropolitan region and it is found that it can be used properly by the urban city planners and supply chain managers to analyze critical nodes of transportation networks of megacities.

New and innovative ways of data collection provide new possibilities to analyze these issues. In this paper we present MASS-GT, a new multi-agent simulation system for urban goods transport. The empirical basis is provided by an exceptionally large dataset of truck trip travel diaries for The Netherlands that was collected from transportation management systems using an automated data collection interface. The dataset is very dense and includes information on vehicles, routes, and shipments carried. The strategic part of the model simulates the formation of individual shipments based on logistic processes at a strategic level, such as sourcing, distribution channel choice and shipment size choice. At tactical level disaggregate choices are simulated for tour formation, vehicle type- and time of day choice, based on observed distributions. The multi-agent approach allows to implement heterogeneous preferences and thus differentiated responses to new policies. We present an application of the model to study the impacts of urban consolidation centers (UCC) and zero emission zones. The freight transportation volumes transported to these UCC and their impact on logistic indicators are analyzed. Simulation results show that vehicle kilometers travelled within the wider region increase with the introduction of UCC, and at the same time the efficiency of deliveries increases as well. Thus the model allows to study trade-offs between regional and local systems that emerge from different behavioural responses to policies.
